Here's the scenario. People are saved by faith in Jesus and thus they enter the Kingdom of God. Does that depend on what church you're associated with? In terms of the historical account of the Church, there are certain doctrinal issues that cause intolerable Church division. The major issue being Catholic versus Protestant versus Unitarian doctrinal incompatiblity. This implies the real story of salvation by faith in Jesus is obscured by divisions in the Church. Within both of these main camps there is more separation of concerns. Is the Catholic church trinitarian? Yes, but the fly in the ointment is their upholding of salvation by sacrament and not by faith. This means the Trinity is devalued by their sacraments because they make Church authority equal with the Lord God's authority. What's curious is the strategy of this culture. It's very similar to that of the Pharisee's and Saducees that Jesus encountered in His life on earth. The strategy is knowledge containment and control by the elite or ruling class for legitimising a political model of governance. All Catholic indulgences that sparked reformation were deemed legitimate by a political machine that was/is the Catholic church. To repudiate the need for a political model, a fair question might be => Will sacremental authority be upheld by the Lord Jesus at the resurrection of the dead? Or will His own verdict be upheld? The answer is obvious. 

The liberty of true prosperity has with it the affirmation of generative power. A man must graduate out of a prison of childish, carnal ignorance in order to enter the Kingdom of God as God intended His Kingdom to be known. To see and understand God's word is greater than anything to be found in all religious academia or even genuine ministry service. To see by the true Light of Christ is the greatest life that can be achieved. To see and understand is to know God personally.
