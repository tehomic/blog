The book of Genesis Chapter one is the Lord God's intelligent design document, providing a witness about the created structure of heaven and the universe. Without doubt there is a significant challenge presented to the reader in order to to appreciate His witness. 
Consider that the world of heaven must surely be dramatically different to earth. The obvious contrast is that heaven is not a physical world. The realm of Heaven compared to Earth is like comparing day and night, spirit and flesh. 

By relative comparison, imagine Heaven is 3 dimensional and "everywhere" while earth is a 2 dimensional "flatland" world controlled by Heaven. The former is true reality while the latter exists by virtue of the former. That is, the Earth and Mankind exist by vitue of the Lord God of Israel, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This means that natural life is like a projected image moving through time, in the same way an image reel moves through the light of a projector.

Add God says I AM - self-existant, but man can only say 'I AM' by virtue of God who gives me the light of light. 
Transition to 'God divided the light from the darkness' in the beginning.

The light of life IS the virtue of Jesus which gives creation opportunity to work and compete

Eventhough a born again Christian is seated in heaven with Christ, unless he/she walks with the Holy Spirit, bible reading and interpretation might be a challenge, because the flesh is spiritual.

<bref>Gal 5:17 NIV</bref>
For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.

This translation gives food for thought, saying "They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want". In other words, when you, the Christian, discern conflict internally between spirit and flesh, stop and think about your **intentions**, especially your motivated planning.

<bref>Rom 8:5 ESV</bref>
For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.


In the book of Daniel, about his dream interpretation, it says the fourth kingdom is one like iron mixed with clay, which apparently indicates a fatally flawed system of government, because footing materials must have compressive strength, able to bear the weight of the body. Iron and clay are completely opposite materials, so immediately we expect this is weakness. But does it absolutely mean weakness? We know the subject is government, so that will depend on the application, arrangement and people? What's interesting is that cured concrete does have compressive strength. Cement, the binding agent of concrete, is a mixture of limestone, clay and sand. When fired in a very hot kiln, these elements crystalise into something called 'clinker'. Finally clinker is ground with gypsum into cement. Reinforced concrete is comparable to a mixture of iron and clay and is very strong. Concrete provides compressive strength to anchor reo-steel bars at the load points of a span, while steel gives tensile strength for spanning an open space. In this way iron and 'clay' are an effective partnership. Perhaps the key principle of this scripture is partnership. The strength of government is partership. Partnership with business, law, academics, education, banking, arts, sport and society. 

This is an example of interpreting scripture with abstractive ideas. 

While preparing this final article about the Days of Creation, I noticed the impressive volume of youtube material dedicated to Creation science and young earth cosmology. From my exposure to Creation ministry content, the main premise of their theology could be captured by psalm 33:6.

<bref>Psa 33:6 NIV</bref>
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.

<bref>Psa 33:6 NLT</bref>
The LORD merely spoke, and the heavens were created. He breathed the word, and all the stars were born.

<bref>Psa 33:6 KJV</bref>
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

When the bible says "the Lord created the heavens by the breath of his mouth", it might be easy to draw a conclusion that God merely spoke and by supernatural power creation immediately stood up to attention. That's the impression that the NLT version gives, by saying 'the Lord merely spoke'. But if you think and ponder about it judiciously, what is the principle word or term that the picture depends on? The term "the Lord created" explains the principle actor and activity. But there is an adverb of sorts that adds depth and backgound to the picture. The Hebrew word Ruach is translated to the english word breath, and either refers to a spirit or to naturally occuring wind. Why does Hebrew apply the same word for wind and spirit? Because both wind and spirit animate the flesh. The wind moves the clouds, trees, water and dirt. Without wind life on earth would not exist because wind makes rain possible. It carries warm water vapour into the colder atmosphere creating clouds. Consider that the violence and power of a storm is just wind. The "breath of God's mouth" is a very important theology statement. It says the Lord God is a person, whose voice is His Word, and breath is His Spirit. This identifies the Trinity. The Father declares His Word (the Son) using His breath (the Spirit). But wait a second, God is spirit !? Breathing is required for flesh but not for Spirit. Ahha ! This is a beautiful analogy that encourages mankind to connect with their maker. The Lord encourages mankind to believe that their image is from God. 

It's an analogy because God is spirit, He does not breath. He does not inhale air and exhale breath. It actually means that creation has an Executor, a very powerful person. He is the Holy Spirit. He does the actual work of creating, and He moves only when God's command is declared. Recall that Gen 1:2 says "The Spirit of God hovered over the waters". This means Holy Spirit was getting in position ready for the water, the Word of God, to flow. Like a runner with their posture set to for takeoff. So the idea that God spoke and immediately the earth changed from nothing into a functional planet is not valid. Since nothing is impossible for God, the Lord CAN create something from nothing, but that not what the bible records. 

<bref>Heb 11:3 NKJV</bref>
By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were **not made of things which are visible.**


<bref>Heb 11:3 NIV</bref>
By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen **was not made out of what was visible.**

The universe, the things which are seen, were not made of things which are visible. The substance of creation is something, and that something is invisible. What is something invisible that can produce visible matter? Answer : energy. Einstein's law of mass and energy to be accurate : E = mc^2. 
It also refers to invisible phyical matter, that is, the atomic elements. The atomic mass of an element is is approximately equivalent to the number of protons and neutrons in the atom (the mass number) or to the average number allowing for the relative abundances of different isotopes. Apart from a neutrino, an electron is the smallest particle having a mass. It also has a wavelength and demonstrates wave like behaviour. The possibility is that an atom is really best described as bounded energy, bounded by a virtual boundary that is not physically detectable.
 
Since the holy angels are like God's sons, like a good Father, the Lord God gives them the privelege of declaring the commands that are entrusted to them. In the first order creation, Arch-angels speak commands for creating worker angels. Later, in the second order creation, worker angels are directed by commander Arch-angels to speak their commands for creating the natural world.


Imagine the scene, kind of like a stage when each of the morning stars has a turn in the spotlight to declare the next creation command. After the natural things appear, an angel or an angel company of the Kingdom is charged to maintain life. That does not mean things are static, quite the opposite. I believe, there is continual warfare in the spiritual heavens designed to uphold or degrade the prosperity of mankind. Each person is pushed and pulled to believe either their eternal identity is real or fake. The consequences of this struggle flow on to affect all of natural life. Realise that Satan and his cohorts hate mankind with a cruel hatred, because if unchallenged the chosen ones of mankind will eventually supercede the angels and one Day start to rule with God, even as the Lord God planned from the beginning. The chosen ones of mankind are Israel, according to the Spirit. The Day of Reckoning happens when the Morning Star, Jesus appears at the Resurrection of the dead. 

----------------- not sure if this is relevent -------------------------------
Consider the vast array of galaxies in the heavenly realm. Genesis 1 says "God made lights in the firmament of heaven to give light on the earth and to divide the light from the darkness". This might be a twofold witness. First, Kingdom angels govern the galaxies maintaining the law of gravity so that the combined stablility and influence of all galaxies adds up, providing conditons for the sun and earth to stay perfectly in place, giving life continuity on earth. Second, it might indicate that 'light on the earth' is a universal term referring to any planet made of stardust orbiting around a star anywhere in the universe. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a huge industry of Christian youtube publishers who I suppose present themselves are champions of the bible. 

The witness embedded in the oracle of God's Word, the Hebrew language. An unavoidable reality is that God's Word has it's own language, a spiritual language that is sometimes strange in contrast to literal and "logical" natural language. 

For example, this spiritual language sometimes personifies objects and animals, giving them intelligence attributes like a human begin.

<bref>Gen 3:1 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”

This verse is one of the most studied and explored verses of the bible, yet do we really know the environment of the story. It's not hard to imagine how an authoritive book that personifies animals might influence story tellers throughout history. Books like the Narnia series by T.S Lewis are an example. 

Is God really saying that the beasts of the fields are intelligent? You might say "He means animal cunning, like a lioness crouching in the grass sneaking up on unsuspecting wilderbeast". It's hard not to smile or giggle, thinking how this cunning comparison could be worked out. Imagine some cartoon african herbivores talking about predators. "Well the lion's main weapon is the ambush because of numbers, but the leopard, ugg, he is a deadly night stalker". As a side note about noctural predators, ever wondered why the zebra is marked with black and white stripes? It's not for daylight hours but for camouflage in the night. You might expect, with there exceptional night vision, leopards would clean up stalking at night, especially when moonlight could reveal their prey. Well the black and white stripes work especially well in the moonlight. Because moonlight casts varying shadows, in that space, a pack of zebras become almost invisible.

But seriously, is there something else that does not rely on personified animals? Yes, He is referring to the angels who govern the lifecycle of every animal type and subtype. These are the Generations, the living types in charge of life continuity and version control, who rule over the Day and and the Night. 
This verse also points to a special Generation, the ministry of Man which decides in advance the type of each human spirit born into the world. For example, in this story the snake represents Satan and that human spirit class that is aligned with Darkness, while Jesus is Lord over the Just, the human spirit class that is aligned with Light.

Recently, I listened to some commentators talking about creation versus intelligent-design. This event was a youtube debate between two Christian academic leaders, both professional scientists, one a creationist the other an evolutionist. A moderator controlled the debate, helping with discussion flow. To start, the premise of the debate was established. This essential concept is the context, setting or picture of Day and Night, which could in other words mean the Frame of Reference for studying the text. The creationist man, in my view, correctly asserted that perceiving the right idea of Day and Night depends on your worldview. This startled me, because it resonates with my own studies. For another discussion about worldview see my previous article called The Eye and the Lamp. The term worldview conjures different impressions for various people. So to use this term, it must be limited by scope, like 'cosmic or local', 'spiritual or natural'. In hearing the arguments of each speaker, the two men of course had distinct views. The creationist, by association, supports a "young earth cosmology" and the evolutionist supports "old earth cosmology". To be accurate, the "old earth cosmology" branch is divided into the secular evolution and intelligent design branches. The former thinks that entropy created life simply because life activity accelerates entropy. Therefore, entropy needs life to support entropy dominance. Sounds like there must be a sinister agency behind this entropy. You're right, it's called Chaos! Haha, a bit a humour adds flavor like salt on a ripe tomato.

Apparently, the young-creation camp interpret a creation Day through the lense of humanity, as a 24 hour period. On the other hand, the intelligent-design camp interpret a Day through the lense of a cosmic creator, that is, a day is as long as it needs to be, depending on the "daily" creation goal.
Being a Chistian, I expected the evolutionist debater to qualify his title, adjusting his base view from evolution to intelligent-design, but he didn't. Although, that's might be default since he's Christian. From listening to the young earth cosmology scientist, it seems that because the creation was declared very good when complete, that means it's absolutely complete, no change is needed ... not tomorrow, not next decade, not even forever. What if "complete and very good" means that it's perfectly calibrated to adaptively handle any kind of random event like an asteroid crashing into the earth.

The intelligent-design branch, to which I belong, believes that the Lord God of Israel designed and created His ministry of creation first. This is not just an idea, rather it is a creation proof that is documented by Genesis 2:4-5. The Generations are the ministry of creation, the angels in charge of generating the natural world, which happens after this Day. Which day? In the day that the Lord God virtually made the earth and heavens, before the natural world existed. The documenting of beasts, birds, animals and man is according to the heavenly realm. This is confirmed by the Word of God which states, "I created everything including man before there was a man to till the ground". Huh? God created man before there was a man? Yes, the Lord God designed and created the ministry of Man, the angels who are in charge of the geneology of Man, exactly what <b1>H8435</b1> is referring to. The Lord God does not personally execute His own creation commands, He creates a whole army of angels to do it according to His commands.

<bref>Isa 53:8 NKJV</bref>
He was taken from prison and from judgment, And who will declare His generation <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1755/kjv/wlc/0-1/"><u>H1755</u></a>? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken.

The comparion of Hebrews words <b1>H8435</b1> and <b1>H1755</b1> show the different activity of a Generation, that is, an order of generating angels, compared to the ruler of creation, Jesus Christ. The oracle of the Hebrew language tells us that being ruler, Jesus is the architect of the foundational clockwork of the universe. That is, gravity and its characterist action of separating clouds of gas and dust and gathering a cluster of dust or gas into a heap, into stars or planets. If you've seen images of cosmic dust and gas gathering into a heap, the attraction of gravity works from the center of mass, working along its field lines that spiral towards the center. This spiraling action also rotates which causes the incoming dust or gas to heap up into a spherical shape. Here is an image of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/hubble-studies-a-spectacular-spiral"><u>Galaxy NGC 1961</u></a>, with beautiful contrasting colors. Notice that the root word of Christ's generation means to gyrate. Since earth was surely created by hot star dust heaping up into a gyrating spheroidal planet, we know exactly what the scripture means concerning a habitation and dwelling place.

Notice that Isaiah 53:8 says "who will declare his generation?". With respect to Jesus as ruler of creation, this could mean "who will inherit His office and signature (signet ring)?". There is an amazing support testimony in Job 38:14 => "The earth takes shape like clay under a seal (signet ring), its features stand out like those of a garment". Also, this verse (53:8) is voicing concern about the Lord's eternal condition, given that He was "cut off" which means put to death. The saints of course know the answer : Jesus is the firstborn from the dead, the first a new type of man called Incorruptible Man.

The reason for adding this scripture review is to emphasise that there is only one worldview that can truely perceive and understand Gods word and His creation. That is, the worldview of the Holy Spirit. This worldview is an amazing gift, it comes from the heart of God, the amazing design attibute that makes Man different from other creatures. Man is created in the image of God, exclusively because the heart of Man is made in the image of God's heart. The bible is a spiritual book. That's why the language might sometimes seem absurd, because its not for natural consumption. By absurd, I mean if not careful you might believe that Gen 3:1 implies that before the Fall, animals could interact with humans and even plot there downfall. Haha, a little humour is always welcome.

About the evening and morning as an indication that God is emphasizing a natural timescale of 24 hours. This is not inline with the prophetic story about that Day when the morning star dawns at   Resurrection morning. Psalms say "when I wake up in the morning I will bear His likeness"

<bref>Gen 1:4-5 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>4</bref> And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. <bref>5</bref> God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.

What does a Day mean? Is it 24 hours or does it means a stage of work? The creationist camp says "there's no hidden meaning, a cosmic day conforms to earth-time because the bible is designed for humans not angels, so lets not confuse them". While the intelligent-design camp says "the evening and morning of a creation Day just describes the beginning and end of a stage of work". 

Let's review the proper interpretation of Light in the Genesis story. The Hebrew dictionary describes light of Genesis as the light of life, which explicitly means Light that represents being alive. This now establishes a logical proof. The light of life, the light of Genesis, is not literal light but spiritual light. The light of Genesis is the light of life, therefore by association a Genesis Day is the period when light prevails continuously. So now we can confidently answer the question : What does a creation Day mean? By by association to light, a spiritual Day is simply the total period of a creature's life. What if the creature is a Generation, a living type? What is the meaning of life and death for this strange creature? It is the total period that a creature Kind is alive and has custody of its own seed for propogating that seed in the natural realm. A creature Kind is related to a creature Type as a human person is related to their ancestors. The way that one Kind is succeeded by a new Kind may be described, in my vernacular anyway, as the Lord God's ministry of version control. It is just one aspect of His intelligent creative design. See how the Lord God may be challenging your worldview about life in the cosmic realm, in the heavenly realm.

What about Genesis Day 1. What is the creature kind that is created on Day 1.

The Day and Night are spiritual terms referring to the Lord's mastery of metamorphosis. The Day defines the period that a creature type is alive and has permission to work and compete. The Night defines transition from life into death, because a type has become obselete and can no longer compete. The implication of Day 1 is that the first Day is founded on the cornerstone of life, that is, Truth is light and False is darkness. Recall that in the beginning "darkness was on the face of the deep". On the first Day, the Ministry of Creation was setup and established, which itself is an act of separating Light from Darkness. In God's account, this ministry of creation is a living creature, and Day 1 is when it was born. The Ruler of Creation is appointed by the Lord God of Israel. The Ruler of Creation is the Light of Creation, and is Jesus Christ.

Find all biblical references that use the phrase - the light of life.

All the following verses give a witness that in the morning, things will change, people and cities will be transformed. This is the witness about the morning and the purpose of the Day. The Day is a period when life is resident and a creature has opportunity to do work. The Night is a time of endurance, waiting for dawn to arrive. It can also be a time of adversity, because darkness may be imposed on someone by the Adversary, and their life and their world is darkened. In this case, rehersal of life is the only recourse to deal with pain, the pain of wasted time and effort. Rehersal is just like an actor preparing to play a role on a stage, when the light of life has come. Rehersal is about meditating on the Word of God as Joshua 1:8 says "Do not let this Word of God (book of the law) depart from your mouth, meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do all that is written in it, then you will be prosperous and have good success". To observe means to perceive by faith.

Job 14:14 NIV
If someone dies, will they live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.

Job 14:14 NKJV
If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, Till my change comes.

Job 14:14 NLT
Can the dead live again? If so, this would give me hope through all my years of struggle, and I would eagerly await the release of death.

Isa 26:19 ESV
Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead.

This verse is referring to the resurrection of the Dead, a day when staggering changes will happen. A new version of life is revealed, for some a life of light and vindication for others the darkness of judgement and death, that is, the second death which is final and unchangable.

Isa 51:17
Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering.

Isa 52:1
Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.

Isa 60:1-2 ESV
Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the Lord will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.

What beautiful language! Arise, your light has 
Rom 13:11-12 ESV
Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.

1 Cor 15:51-54 ESV
Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”

John 5:28-29
Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

Again the resurrection reveals God's grand plan of justice and righteous judgement.

Psa 57:8 ESV
Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!

Mal 4:2
But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.

Again the sun will rise with healing in its wings. In the morning, what was broken and destroyed by Sin will be remade strong and healthy.

2 Peter 1:19
And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,

Peter says the prophetic word is confirmed by Holy Spirit revelation, which is described as the morning star of Christ rising in our hearts. That is, the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophesy. Authentic revelation imparts life, transforming the heart.

John 11:11
After saying these things, he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.”

Lazarus was dead, he went to Sheol for a short time, he entered the Night season, a place of obscurity. This is reflected by the passing of time, during his Night season. If not redeemed from Sheol, His name and legacy will eventually pass away from memory of those who knew him and even the record of his existance will eventually be lost. But Jesus was ready to raise him from the dead. Jesus has to explain to his disciples that sleeping was not about the natural but instead spiritual.

Psalm 90:14
Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

The morning is about renewal and revival. Dead creatures come to life in the morning. That is the context of Day and Night.

1 Thess 5:6-8
So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.

Those who sleep, sleep at night, the drunkards get drunk at night. This shows a slight variation about the Night. The subjects of the Night in this verse are still living and breathing. But they have let go of hope, and decided to forget about the purpose of life and the fear of God. They slip into the obscurity of virtual death, their minds darkened by ignorance.

Isa 51:9
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in days of old, the generations of long ago. Was it not you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon?

Psalm 17:15
As for me, I will see Your face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake in Your likeness.

Notes on the purpose of dividing the light from the darkness
---------------------------------------------------------------

About Genesis 1:3

God divided the light from the darkness. This might point or refer to knowledge assessment and separation of truth from lies, authentic knowledge from fake knowledge. If God simply speaks and creations creatures are created instantly then there is no information transfer from the Lord God to His workers, to the angels. There is no real direction or workflow from God to the angels. If God just speaks and things are created instantly in their mature form then how does God's Kingdom work in contrast to a magical kingdom. There's no real difference in quality, although the purpose of working would be very different.

Light is primarily associated with truth and also denotes life, because truth is the very essence of God's government that gives licence to live and breath in the earthly realm.

Also, refer to God's name IAM to help the reader perceive the only true God is the one who is Absolutely self-sufficient in life. Only the Lord God has real authentic life, and every other creature that lives does so by virtue of permission from the Lord God. In other words a creature, one who is created, does not really have any right to declare IAM. They really should declare 'I am by virtue of God's permission, purpose and desire'. Every christian should occasionally declare 'I am in Christ'. If this was stated as scripture, then the amplified bible would say 'I am [alive by faith] in Christ'.

In this true account might be a hidden revelation why all creature sins can only be remitted by the blood of another creature, or by one who accepts custody of the common creature type.

Like a sheep that is silent before her shearers, so He did not open his mouth. Jesus the Lamb of God prophesised by Moses in the story of the Passover. This clearly shows that the primary context of scripture is spiritual. The Christ is not a literal sheep, He is a man, God in the flesh, who does the same actions predicted by the prophets that came after Moses, which declare that He will offer himself as a sacrifice for sin. Therefore, what is the proper context of Genesis? It must be spiritual because the Revelation declares that Christ is the Ruler of creation and the prophers declares the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophesy.

Notes about the revelation that competition explains what creation is doing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<bref>Isa 50:4 NKJV</bref>
The Lord GOD has opened My ear; And I was not rebellious, Nor did I turn away

<bref>Isa 50:4 NIV</bref>
The Sovereign LORD has opened my ears; I have not been rebellious, I have not turned away

<bref>Psa 40:6 NKJV</bref>
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; My ears You have opened. Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require.

<bref>Psa 40:6 NLT</bref>
You take no delight in sacrifices or offerings. Now that you have made me listen, I finally understand— you don’t require burnt offerings or sin offerings.

The root word of the hebrew word for morning means ->
1. to seek, enquire, consider
  (Piel)
    to seek, look for
    to consider, reflect

So to seek, to enquire implies a willingness to listen to a wise counsellor
To consider, to reflect means to meditate on the advice, instuction even commands of the counsellor

The principle of Day and Night is about Spirit versus Flesh competing for dominance. In the Day and Night of creation 2 or more virtual creatures are competing in the Day striving to beat one another for the prize of having their seed continue when the night comes around. The saint is challenged to decide which version of themselves will win the race to carry seed into the next generation, the next version, but the compatants are Spirit versus Flesh.

Two cases for the saint call to compete for a greater life. 1. The call says "You're not ambitious enough ! I've called you to do more, follow me to go higher and above what you current limit is now. 2. The call says "you're languishing in prison because you have great talent. Follow the Holy Spirit's leadership to break out of prison and do great exploits for Jesus."

What is this talk about virtual creatures and virtual seed? Realise that the gospel has given this vital information to provide education about the most characteristic of all - your type of spirit. Those who are led by the Holy Spirit gain more and more Christ likeness as they journey in life. Likeness in terms of type - put it this way - all behavior is explained by the types of person or spirit. Not emotions, not intellect, not ethnic origins. Type of person rules over everthing else. That's why the bible says 'your whole life is a competition that compels man to choose between 2 kinds of seed - the Spirit of Christ or the spirit of Antichrist or Flesh.'
