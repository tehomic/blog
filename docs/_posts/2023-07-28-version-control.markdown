The bible gives abundant clues and pointers about the primary reason for it's existance. The first part, in the beginning, documents the Genesis of life, and the Source of life. That source is not a literal spring or fountain but a spirit, a most holy person, in fact three persons binded together in unity : the Lord God of Israel. All unique but also perfectly one in agreement. Genesis is a facinating story of the actors who appear on the creation stage doing their role sythesizing both spirits and flesh. It should not be surprising that a depiction of the Heavenly realm is strange compared to earth. Also the creatures within that world WILL initially be strange according to their identity and life conditions. That is, since the angels are the living type, they are named according to the natural type each one has custody of. Isaiah 55:12 says "You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands". This means the angels in charge of the mountains will rejoice and the angels in charge of the trees will rejoice, clapping and cheering.

By studying the Genesis story, the discerning reader might realise that God desired in the beginning to build His kingdom, starting initially with His own house and workforce of angels. The initial size of God's house is not revealed but its clear that the first angels are the arch-angels. These are the holy ones who are God's personal attendants and leaders, such as Gabriel and Michael. By starting with this initial picture, we can track the progressive expansion of God's house and kingdom. 

The curious reader might also notice that Heavens are plural, indicating distinct regions that are closed to all traffic unless the King's business requires passage through the gateway at the border of each world.

<bref>Gen 1:6-8 KJV</bref>
.<bref>6</bref> And God said, Let there be a firmament <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7549"><u>H7549</u></a> in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. <bref>7</bref> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. <bref>8</bref> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

<br/>

An amazing theme of the bible is the design principle of God, creating a perfect model of the natural world in the heavenly realm first. Notice that the root verb says "to spread out, stretch out". From this clue we can deduce that God is modelling the universe by creating a new heavenly realm which is the second heaven and initially empty. Later when the arch-angels create worker angels and populate heaven, the arrangement will expand and stretch to accomodate the workers in their vast array. Other features of the second heaven =>
1. it separates the waters from the waters, meaning it is designed to stretch so that angel companies can spread out and separate from each other, exactly the way stars are separate from each other but initially were all mixed in a mega-sea of hot material. My guess is that the angel companies can still communicate between stations, in the same way that stars are virtually connected by gravity.
2. The angels are the living type of the natural feature they represent. This is clearly seen by angels who are lights in the firmament. These spiritual lights are charged with governing the physical stars and planets in the natural universe. By governing, they provide "light" on the earth, needed for doing work. That is they regulate the timing of days, seasons, and years which is recorded in Genesis 1:14b "let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years"

So the Firmament is the second heaven below God's heavenly headquarters. Apparently there is a "solid" barrier, which might be comparable in purpose to the wall of Jerusalem which has battlements, gates and bars. The bible describes it as a sea of virtual gemstone and possibly varying from translucent to perfectly clear.

<bref>Eze 1:22 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>22</bref> The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out over their heads.

<bref>Eze 1:22 NIV</bref>
.<bref>22</bref> Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome.

<bref>Exo 24:9-10 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>9</bref> Then Moses went up, also Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, <bref>10</bref> and they saw the God of Israel. And there was under His feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and it was like the very heavens in its clarity.

<bref>Rev 4:6 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>6</bref> Before the throne *there* was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, *were* four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.

Genesis support commentaries appears many times throughout the bible, supplementing the first narrative with more information describing the key elements of creation.

<bref>Job 9:8 NIV</bref>
.<bref>8</bref> He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.

Is the One who treads on the waves of the sea the same person who walked on the sea of Galilee ... yes! The Son of God, Jesus Christ is His name.

<bref>Psa 104:2 NIV</bref>
.<bref>2</bref> The LORD wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent

<bref>Isa 40:22 NIV</bref>
.<bref>22</bref> He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in

<bref>Isa 42:5 NIV</bref>
.<bref>5</bref> This is what God the LORD says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it:

<bref>Isa 44:24 NIV</bref>
.<bref>24</bref> This is what the LORD says— your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens, who spreads out the earth by myself,

<bref>Isa 45:12 KJV</bref>
.<bref>12</bref> I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.

<bref>Isa 48:13 NIV</bref>
.<bref>13</bref> My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they all stand up together

<bref>Isa 51:13 BSB</bref>
.<bref>13</bref> But you have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. You live in terror all day long because of the fury of the oppressor who is bent on destruction. But where is the fury of the oppressor?

<bref>Jer 10:12 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>12</bref> He has made the earth by His power, He has established the world by His wisdom, And has stretched out the heavens at His discretion.

<bref>Jer 51:15 BSB</bref>
.<bref>15</bref> The LORD made the earth by His power; He established the world by His wisdom and stretched out the heavens by His understanding


<bref>Zech 12:1-2 NIV</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> A prophecy: The word of the LORD concerning Israel. The LORD, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: <bref>2</bref> I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.

These verses support the original text in Genesis :

<bref>Gen 1:9-10 KJV</bref>
.<bref>9</bref> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry *land* appear: and it was so <bref>10</bref> And God called the dry *land* Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that *it was* good

You might wonder why I suggest there is a connection between "waters gathered together unto one place" and "stretching out the heavens". This is related to the firmament design described previously. Now the phase of creation has advanced and now the firmament is being filled and stretched.

The earth also is "spread out" in the heavens. Another journal called "The Workdays of Creation" suggests that the Earth, our earth, may not really be the main attraction of Genesis. The term Earth is not referring directly to our planet, but rather a general term, referring to collected star dust, the material dirt of planet composition throughout the universe. In the same way, the gathering of the waters is not referring directly to the oceans and seas of our earth. This term is far more significant, it points to the progressive dispersal of the original super flood of hot matter and energy. This is describing the later synthesis of stars by separation of the hot material flood into smaller seas which are hydrogen gas collections that become the stars. The "gathering of the waters" also means creation and assignment of angels into groups that dwell together in the heavenly place where they are stationed.

This is apprehended by the term waters, which refers to angels who have custody of God's creative commands. That's why the angel is called water. He is defined by Gods command that is entrusted to him. What an amazing use of language! It describes both the creation of the creators, and the intelligent design documented by a sea of commands. This is God's brilliant design principle : first document the design, the engineering commands of the Lord God, so that the account of what to do and when to do it is recorded. The worker angels are the living type of the creature that they produce, including stars and planets, mountains and trees. 

This is a strong witness about God's amazing intelligent design. By you might say "I'm not convinced this is right, because God seems to describe only one creation story, that is, the natural world".

Well, in fact Genesis does describe separate heavenly and earthly creation episodes.

<bref>Gen 1:20,21,25 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>20</bref> Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.” <bref> 21</bref> So God created great sea creatures <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H8577"><u>H8577</u></a> and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good ... <bref>25</bref> And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

<bref>Gen 2:19 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>20</bref> Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.

Here the bible makes a clear distinction between first and second order creation activity. The first order creation concerns the production of worker angels by the arch-angels. This is work that stretches the firmament in the second heaven, creating a model of the natural universe. "Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures" means "let the worker angels come forth in abundance, the living type of every kind of natural thing". It also means "let the living types come forth abundanty, the flesh-generators in their vast array". In God's unique language, it also describes in advance how natural life starts in the oceans and migrates to the land, by amphibians and reptiles. 

Then later in chapter 2, the narrative changes deliberately to help the discerning reader understand which realm is the current world. The text says "out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field". This clearly indicates that God made the flesh of all animals including the flesh of man from a host of physical carbon molecules.

As a side note, about the actual Hebrew meaning of the term "great sea creatures" =>

<hr/>
<br/>

The term "great sea creatures" is conservative considering that the associated meaning says "a monster". Compared to reptiles, mammalian whales probably require a different more advanced world to exist. The alternate and more logical idea which the dictionary actually suggests is that monsterous sea creatures are reptilian dinosaurs. These reptiles eventually migrated to the land giving rise to monsterous land dinosaurs.

Another amazing feature of God's intelligent design is how He established the science of ecology in the heavenly realm to govern natural life on earth.

<bref>Gen 1:12-14 KJV</bref>
.<bref>12</bref> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<bref>13</bref> And the evening and the morning were the third day. <bref>14</bref> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to **divide the day from the night**; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years

In verse 12, God is describing the key principle of life on earth : propogation of seed which passes on to the next generation. But how does the germinated seed transform into the flesh of the plant or animal? Before the seed germinates or conceives a single cell host is prepared. The resident generator program installs itself in the single cell. Like virtual software, this generator is designed to drive metabolic cell reproduction. So the seed dies, releasing a life producing single cell into the world. From a single cell, the creature program forms the plant or animal body, causing it to grow and expand. Genesis day four says "let there be lights in the heavens to divide the day from the night". This is super interesting because it logically must be connected to the day three account. It is talking about the other key principle of life on earth and the perpetuation of natural life by Generational version control. What does version control mean? It actually means ... evolution! The spiritual Daytime is referring to the period when a particular creature version is resident on the earth, breathing air and feeling the warmth of sunlight. That is, until its inevitable departure when the next iteration of its kind requires appearance based on the changing demands of existance in the world.

<bref>Gen 1:17-18 KJV</bref>
<bref>17</bref> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth <bref>18</bref> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H216"><u>H216</u></a> from the darkness <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2822"><u>H2822</u></a>: and God saw that it was good.

<br/>

Comparing the meaning of light and darkness shows a certain contrast for interpretating how to apply these terms. For light, the Hiphil third person tense says illuminate, to give light, to cause to shine. While for darkness the Hiphil tense says to make dark, to obscure, confuse. These terms have a symbolic or spiritual connotation. My reckoning is that the Daytime is the time of life under the sun, when the actor has opportunity to act and compete. Night is the time of death, when the actor is hidden with no opportunity to act because it is no longer competitive. What's curious is that apart from the zoological idea of survival of the fitest, the reality of this idea exists in free market economics. That is, a product or service is alive as long as it commands a chunk of the market share, but if it falls out of favour and does not compete with the other players, then it will pass away from the daylight and slide into the shadows of product history, into obscurity. For example, the original still photo camera of the 1950's to 80's era was superceded by the digital camera and gradually faded into camera product history. The product type called "realtime picture making device" still continued but with a next generation model.
