<subhead><p>The Lord God's voice and his word are described as water</p></subhead>

This also applies to all spiritual beings created by the Lord God.

<bref>Ezek 43:2b KJV</bref>
And his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory 

<bref>Rev 14:2a KJV</bref>
And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters

<subhead><p>Collective spiritual speech and language is described as a flood or a sea</p></subhead>

This is intuitive, given that the voice of a spiritual being is like an audible stream of rushing waters.

<bref>Prov 18:4 BSB</bref>
The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.

This verse is a standout and great example of how the Lord invites you to believe him through a fresh and exciting way to see his Word. The first part says “The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters”. This means the words in a man’s heart are stored in his memory, both short and long term. The deep water refers to a reservoir or “sea” of thoughts and memories. Thoughts are like deep water currents circulating in the sea, and are not audible except to the owner. When the man prepares to speak he draws out the water directing it into a stream that flows over his tongue. This happens in mere microseconds and is a biblical picture of the subconscious. “The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook” is a beautiful metaphor that explains that when the water flows on the tongue it is audible. A bubbling brook is audible. A very pleasant sound, just like someone speaking wisdom. Even more, I believe the main reason why the spiritual heart is called a heart is that it emulates the natural heart by pumping fluid, doing a vital life sustaining function. The spiritual heart pumps water while the natural heart pumps blood. Praise the Lord Jesus !

<bref>Prov 20:5 BSB</bref>
Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out

How does the man of understanding draw out the water? By meditating, by musing, he conceives a new idea. He captures it and “pumps” it out of the deep sea into his "new ideas" holding tank for more development. Then at the right time, he channels it onto his tongue and we hear the words. What a beautiful picture of God’s amazing design!

<bref>Eph 5:26 BSB</bref>
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word

<bref>Rev 17:1 BSB</bref>
Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.

<bref>Rev 17:15 BSB</bref>
And he says to me, "The waters that you saw where the prostitute sits ARE peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.

#### **The Flood in Genesis**

<bref>Psalm 29:3 NIV</bref>
The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD thunders over the mighty waters.

<bref>Psalm 29:3 NKJV</bref>
The voice of the LORD is over the waters; The God of glory thunders; The LORD is over many waters.

<bref>Psalm 29:10 NIV</bref>
The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever

The waters that are above the firmament are referring to the Flood that God sits enthroned above. The Flood represents the principalities and powers in the 2nd heaven, which actually carry out the governing of the universe and earth, being directed and commanded either by the Lord God in the 3rd heaven or in terms of Sin, Satan in the 2nd heaven. 

<bref>Rev 16:5 NIV</bref>
Then I heard the angel **in charge of the waters** say: “You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were; for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve”

I believe that Satan was ejected from the 3rd heaven but not the 2nd. We know he was thrown down to the earth, having the nefarious title of “Prince of the power of the air” on earth. I reckon this means he still operates in the 2nd heaven, because the foundations of the earth are controlled in the 2nd heaven. 

The principalities and powers are of course split into the light and dark powers of Jesus and Satan respectively. The Government of the earth actually happens here, in terms of the flux of international power and rulership on earth. This is why <b1>Rev 17:15</b1> says “the waters ARE peoples, multitudes, nations and tongues”. 

Speech, language and words are virtually water. Why, because they act the same as water, being collected and directed by a heavenly influence. Natural water flows from the high mountains down to the seas and oceans, by the force of gravity. In the deep, water flows powerfully in currents driven by temperature flux and tides. The whole ocean animal kingdom depends on currents that move life (dissolved oxygen) from one place to another. Sea mammals depend on fish with gills, so they indirectly depend on the currents as well. 

Consider that a person’s thought life constitutes their soul. Why? Because that’s how the Lord (I AM) estimates the value of a soul. By the motives, plans and schemes of the heart.

The deeper question about God’s word in Genesis is not what He said but the context and arrangement of Heaven when He spoke. Are there different orders/stages of creation? Ans – Yes

Points
* Genesis Chapter 1 refers to God, called Elohim, which is grammatically plural.
* Genesis Chapter 2 refers to Lord God, called Jehovah, the Trinity
* The Living Creation serves God in the Lord’s ministry of creation. 

### **Elohim is God’s Government**

Elohim is plural because a body has many members.  Elohim are the Holy angels, the hands and feet of Jesus, ready to execute his commands. The body of Christ in the heavenly realm is God's government.

In Chapter 1, Elohim must be small in number, compared to the final complete angelic host. In chapter 1:1 they are the special 3rd heaven angels that are most holy among the angels, ie, Archangels. They are not in front of or before Jesus in any way. Jesus is the firstborn of God. In the case of Jesus, firstborn does not mean created, but preeminent, first in rank and place.

I propose that Genesis Chapter 1 describes God progressively creating the 1st order arrangement of the universe in the spiritual realm. What is this arrangement? It is the very Government of the God of Israel in the 2nd heavens. It is God’s ministry of creation which is a prerequisite for the 2nd order physical creation to happen. 

<subhead><p>Supporting scriptures</p></subhead>

<bref>Psalm 148:1-6 BSB</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> Hallelujah! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places. <bref>2</bref> Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts <bref>3</bref> Praise Him, O sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars. <bref>4</bref> Praise Him, O highest heavens, and **you waters above the skies**. <bref>5</bref> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for **He gave the command and they were created**. <bref>6</bref> He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away.

Notice that verse 4 personifies the waters, saying “Praise Him O highest heavens and you waters above the skies”. This is yet another verse that confirms the waters are not literal waters, but the created angels in charge of ruling the physical universe.

<bref>Heb 11:3 NIV</bref>
By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.

<bref>Heb 11:3 NKJV</bref>
By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.

Consider Genesis chapter 1 with Elohim, the Archangels, declaring the works of creation. 

To prove this, let’s look at another scripture =>

<bref>Judges 2:1-3 BSB</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I had promised to your fathers, and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you, <bref>2</bref> and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.’ Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this? <bref>3</bref> So now I tell you that I will not drive out these people before you; they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.”

Here the angel of the Lord is speaking in the first person, on behalf of God. There are many, many scripture verses with the same angelic spokesman context. Holy angels are God’s messengers who bear God’s name, representing Him and His authority. Therefore, we now understand the mandate of Elohim as decreed by the Lord God. This special mandate indicates that Elohim are **authorised and directed by God** to declare the story and works of creation on behalf of the Lord God.

### **The Ministry of Creation**

<bref>Rom 8:19-21</bref>
“The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, **not by its own choice**, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from the bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.”

The scripture says “not by its own choice” which clearly means the creature has a mind like God or man. So this living creature must be the angels of the Lord God.

Moreover, this means that the living creation is the 1st order creation, a creature itself that God made to execute God's 2nd order commands, creating all the natural heavens and earth bound life. The living creation dwells in the 2nd heaven, in the principalities and powers. The literal and physical heavens and earth were not created in Chapter 1. The living creature that does the physical creation was made, because that is the design of God. A living creature with all the genius of God inside him is the engineer of a physical creation that happens next. 

Consider again that God says “the creation was frustrated, not by its own choice”. Another translation says that “the creation groans”. Notice that the scripture which cannot be broken says that the Creation has emotions and groans, waiting in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. Why does the Lord bother to say “Creation groans” since we know that inanimate parts of creation don’t have that ability? He could have said the “Angels groan” because they see and sympathise. Angels and man can groan, lions roar, bears growl, dogs howl and cats … don’t seem to have this trait! In Rom 8:19-20, the Lord did not say Mankind groans because he’s not referring to the earthly domain.

Why then does the Lord deliberately describe these holy angels as “the Creation”? Because they ARE the first order creation. They are Living creatures, created to operate in the 2nd heavens, ruling over the whole natural creation. 

<bref>Gen 1:14-18 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>14</bref> Then God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years; <bref>15</bref> and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. <bref>16</bref> Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. <bref>17</bref> God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, <bref>18</bref> and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

Here, the lights in the firmament of the heavens, the stars, are created before the sun and moon. In the natural, this means that the sun is a younger star than the first stars of creation. What about the phrase "to give light on the earth"? This is a virtual context. It does not mean to provide luminance, because starlight does not provide usable light to physically see your environment. It means they, the holy angels, govern righteously by generally maintaining the lifecycle of the natural world. This includes the physical universe, generally keeping all mechanics within the bounds of God’s physical laws. It's curious that the natural division of day and night is powered by the earth's rotation which is directly due to gravity. The spiritual division of day and night points to the progressive advancement of applied knowledge. Ignorance is darkess, but light is the knowledge of God. Whether the Lord God is acknowledged depends on the kind of witness provided and audience participation. They give light also in terms of inspiring faith in the God of Israel by giving a reliable witness that says “Behold, the intelligent design of the Living God!”. 

These angel bands are called Generations and are the virtual type of every physical heavenly body and earth bound natural creature. God’s word refers to both angels and literal stars as a heavenly host. When we get to heaven, I’m sure Jesus will reveal that even natural stars are virtually living, not just heat and light generators. For instance, the Lord gave me a theory that stellar nuclear fusion is a harmonic reaction. This means a star does not continually burn its fuel, but rather fusion is an explosive event that immediately creates thermal expansion of the inner-core. Since fusion products marginally increase inner-core mass density, this ever increasing gravitational power causes the thermal expansion to quickly reduce back to zero, then advances into a compression phase that is now compressing the inner-core which leads to another “crunch and kaboom” fusion event, starting another harmonic cycle. This means that all natural stars have a heartbeat ! 

This also explains how a star explosion (supernova) happens for particular stars that are perfectly composed of the right elements. For this kind of star, the ever increasing mass density of the inner core approaches an instability state. There must be a singularity of gravitational power that creates a fusion event but resists thermal expansion so that thermal pressure causes fusion in addition to gravitational pressure. This triggers an exponential “runaway” of fusion reactions which leads to death by explosion.

<subhead><p>Living creatures are not mortal</p></subhead>

You might say “Mankind is a living creature, in fact all of the flora and fauna are living creatures”. Not compared to the heavenly realm. Living creatures, with a capital “L”, either means eternal creatures, or very long lived creatures relative to a mere mortal. The bible gives light about who is Living or Dead. 

<bref>Gen 15:6 NIV</bref>
Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.

<bref>Hab 2:4 BSB</bref>
Look at the proud one; his soul is not upright—but the righteous will live by faith

<bref>Mark 12:27 NIV</bref>
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”

<bref>Luke 20:38 NIV</bref>
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”

The bible says “The just will live by faith”. The spiritual Dead are those who refuse to believe the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

<subhead><p>Eternal life is inherited</p></subhead>

<bref>Exodus 3:13-14 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>13</bref> Then Moses said to God, “Indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His name?’ what shall I say to them?” <bref>14</bref> And God said to Moses, “I AM <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H1961"><u>H1961</u></a> WHO I AM <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H1961"><u>H1961</u></a>.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, ‘I AM <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H1961"><u>H1961</u></a> has sent me to you.’ ”

The Hebrew word <b1>H1961</b1> means “to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out”

Here the Lord is introducing the first principles of how to approach faith in God. God is the only one who has the right to claim “I Am” or “I Exist” status. Any thinking person might also wonder “if God says his name is ‘I Am’ then only those who belong to God will inherit this attribute. Also this attribute must be spiritual since God is Spirit“. I suppose people who are of true faith, like Moses, will always esteem the Fear of the Lord, because true existence can only be inherited from God. 

In summary, the Living Creation are all creatures that are created in God’s likeness, whether deep or shallow copy, who are obedient and loyal to God, thus inheriting God’s eternal life. By shallow or deep copy, I mean that a shallow copy may not inherit God’s eternal life because of vulnerability to rebellion. In contrast, Jesus Christ is the perfect image of God. In that sense, He is a deep copy of God.

<bref>Col 1:15 BSB</bref>
The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/G4416"><u>G4416</u></a> over all creation.

<bref>2 Cor 5:17 BSB</bref>
Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come!

Hooray!! All who are believers in Christ Jesus are a new Living creation. This means we are included in the Living Creation, by inheriting eternal life from God our true Father.

Let me confirm that by saying Jesus is a deep copy of God, I don’t mean He is created. The root word of “firstborn” means first in time, place and rank, which exactly describes the Ruler of Creation.

### **Corruptible Man**

<bref>Gen 1:26 KJV</bref>
And God said, Let us make man H120 in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

<bref>Gen 2:7 KJV</bref>
And the LORD God formed man <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H120"><u>H120</u></a> of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H120"><u>H120</u></a> became a living soul.

<bref>1 Cor 15:47-49 BSB</bref>
.<bref>47</bref> The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. <bref>48</bref> As was the earthly man, so also are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. <bref>49</bref> And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so also shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.

<br/>
As for quality, the first Adam’s image of God is a phantom, an illusion, compared to the real image found in Jesus. Being made a mere shadow of God indicates that Adam was a Corruptible Man, according to type. That means that he was weak and feeble against the threat of Sin and Death, and he was designed to be naturally biased. 

Adam was made ruler over all flora and fauna on Earth. Was he a ruler in the principalities and powers? Was the garden of Eden virtually in the heavenly realm? Considering that before the Fall, Adam was made of the dust of the ground, then he was not a ruler in heaven, so Adam was an earthbound man and Eden was an earthly garden. 

### **Holy Spirit is over the waters**

<bref>Genesis 1:2 NIV</bref>
Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

<bref>Genesis 1:2 KJV</bref>
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

What does “without form and void” mean?

Here is what <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/void"><u>www.vocabulary.com</u></a> says, even quoting our biblical verse =>

- Noun 
    * an empty area or space
        - “the huge desert voids”
        - synonyms : emptiness, vacancy, vacuum
- Noun 
    * the state of nonexistence

        - synonyms : invalidate, vitiate
<hr/>
<br/>
Chapter 1 says “the earth was formless and void”. This means it … did … not … exist .. at the time !! By implication nothing physical existed. The host called Spacetime did not exist. The 2nd heavens did not even exist, let alone the 1st, only the 3rd. Holy Spirit is waiting for the commands of creation to be released so that He can go to work. I suggest that the command “Let there be light”, refers to Jesus being appointed leader of the creation project, in partnership with the Holy Spirit. 

The Holy Spirit is hovering over the waters and darkness (obscurity) was on the face (in front of, or behind) the Deep (interface between heaven and nature). This could mean prehistoric spacetime was both a physical void and spiritual place of disorder, chaos and obscurity. Perhaps a degenerated remnant of the previous world that was destroyed in a previous age. In pseudo-science prose, the Deep is the interface between the virtual and spacetime realms. Spacetime is the primary host of the natural world.

God’s word is his supernatural command. The waters, plural, represent the collection or “sea” of God’s creative commands. The bible narrative explains that God, of course, is not limited even though the initial state is hopeless. 

Peter refers to this previous world in his 2nd epistle

<bref>2 Peter 3:5-6 NIV</bref>
.<bref>5</bref> But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water. <bref>6</bref> By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.

<bref>2 Peter 3:5-6 BSB</bref>
.<bref>5</bref> But they deliberately overlook the fact that long ago by God’s word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water, <bref>6</bref> through which the world of that time perished in the flood.

Notice that Peter says 1 “the earth was formed out of water” and 2 “by these waters also it perished”. The earth is like a prototype mammal ! It was formed in virtual waters and comes out of the same waters? All mammalian life is formed in a womb of water and is born out of the water. The old world was generated and destroyed by the Flood. So many witnesses about the Flood that creates and destroys! This is the same 2nd heaven Flood, in terms of role and influence. Not the same angels, but the same creature type. The old world was destroyed by its angelic government, then the Most High destroyed the destroyer ! 

<bref>Isa 33:1 NIV</bref>
Woe to you, destroyer, you who have not been destroyed! Woe to you, betrayer, you who have not been betrayed! When you stop destroying, you will be destroyed; when you stop betraying, you will be betrayed.

The bible shows that the “gods”, the Flood, are charged with governing humanity, and will be judged for any corrupt ministry. Concerning this aspect of the Flood, the author of this text cites this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=the+unseen+realm+youtube#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:81978178,vid:2QM7anD5vSI"><u>video</u></a> as the teaching <sup>3</sup>source

<bref>Psalm 82:1-8 NIV</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> A psalm of Asaph. God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgement among the “gods" : <bref>2</bref> “How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked? <bref>3</bref> Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed <bref>4</bref> Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked. <bref>5</bref> “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. <bref>6</bref> “I said, ‘You are “gods"; you are all sons of the Most High.’ <bref>7</bref> But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler.” <bref>8</bref> Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.

Notice it says “you will die like mere mortals, you will fall”. Sound familiar ? The same judgement fell on the first Adam. Wonder where Adam fell from, since he was with God in the earthly garden? He fell from grace, he virtually fell from heaven to earth.

### **Jesus in the beginning**

<bref>Rev 3:14  NIV</bref>
To the angel of the church of Laodicea write : These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, **the ruler of God’s creation**. 

God said “Let there be light” at verse 1:3 before he said on the fourth day, in verse 1:14, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky … the greater light (sun) to govern the day and the lesser light (moon) to govern the night”. 

.<b1>Psalm 72</b1> is a messianic psalm of Solomon, that describes all the goodness of a righteous King.

<bref>Psalm 72:17 Aramaic Bible in Plain English</bref>
And his Name shall be blessed to eternity and **his Name is before the sun**; all the nations will be blessed in him and they all will glorify him.

<bref>Psalm 72:17 Literal Standard Version</bref>
His Name is for all time, **Before the sun is His Name continued**, And they bless themselves in Him, All nations pronounce Him blessed.

<bref>Psalm 72:17 KJV</bref>
His name <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H8034"><u>H8034</u></a> shall endure forever <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5769"><u>H5769</u></a>, his name <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H8034"><u>H8034</u></a> shall be continued <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5125"><u>H5125</u></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5125"><u>H5125</u></a> as long as <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6440"><u>H6440</u></a> the sun <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H8121"><u>H8121</u></a>, and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H833"><u>H833</u></a>.

The KJV and most interpretive bible versions say ‘as long as the sun’ but the literal versions correctly say ‘before the sun’. The Hebrew word <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6440"><u>H6440</u></a> means “face” which in verse 17 surely means one existed before the other, because it implies a relative order. Indeed the Hebrew meaning says “before and behind”. It might also imply that Christ is the face of the sun, both **in front** and **the front** of the sun. John says in Revelation “I turned and saw one like the Son of Man … his face was like the sun shining in its strength”.

Since <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/bsb/psalms/72.htm"><u>psalm 72</u></a> is messianic, it is pointing to Christ. Jesus comes before the sun, since He is the ruler of creation. The Word of God confirms this =>

<bref>Col 1:15-17 NIV</bref>
.<bref>15</bref> The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <bref>16</bref> For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. <bref>17</bref> He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

Here in Colossians, the scripture states clearly that in the beginning, Jesus Christ was there directing the creation of thrones, powers, rulers and authorities. He was in the very beginning, before any principalities and powers were made. The scripture very clearly states : “He is before all things”. Therefore the first act of creation : “Let there be light” must be the appointment of Jesus as the Ruler of creation.

Let's follow some more breadcrumbs about Christ in the beginning

<bref>Prov 8:22 BSB</bref>
The LORD created me as His first course, before His works of old. From everlasting <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5769"><u>H5769</u></a> I was established, from the beginning, before the earth began.

<bref>Prov 8:22 NKJV</bref>
“The LORD possessed me in the beginning of His way, Before His works of old. I have been established from everlasting <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5769"><u>H5769</u></a>. From the beginning, before there was ever an earth.

<bref>Prov 8:30 BSB</bref>
Then I was a skilled craftsman <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H525"><u>H525</u></a> at His side, and His delight day by day, rejoicing always in His presence.

<bref>Prov 8:30 NKJV</bref>
Then I was beside Him as a master craftsman <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H525"><u>H525</u></a>; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,

<bref>John 17:24 NKJV</bref>
Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.

Proverbs is talking about wisdom personified whom God the Father possessed in the beginning. This is another witness declaring Jesus Christ in the beginning. I initially thought it might rather be a witness about Holy Spirit, the craftsman in partnership with Jesus. Lets look and the Hebrew meaning of craftsman <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H525"><u>H525</u></a> =>

Apparently in the beginning, Jesus was not immediately ready to do his great creative works. Perhaps the first stage of creation, a pre-creation stage, was a training period. He was trained and brought up through a learning process, which is a Son of God experience. Actually I asked Him about this saying “Holy Spirit, in the beginning, did you provide support and training, or were you yourself supported?” He answered “I provide support and training”. Look again at the 3 tenses of the word, Aman. Qal, is the first person leader/teacher tense. This points to Holy Spirit giving support. Niphal, is the 2nd person follower/student tense. This points to Jesus being trained by Holy Spirit. Hiphal is the qualified first person tense. This points to Jesus passing his exams with first class honors ! Notice that the operative trait of a strong student is Trust. God required Jesus to trust Him, standing firm as Ruler of Creation.

This is awesome ! If it’s ok for the Lord Jesus to submit to training and learn to be a great craftsman, then we should be willing to learn as well. 

This also suggests how completely opposite the real creation narrative is compared to the lazy account that says Gods just spoke “Come forth !!” and all the universe and all the earth just instantly stood up like a harry potter episode. No! Apparently the Lord Jesus had to prove He was qualified to be the Ruler of Creation. Question is : who among the saints are even aware that they might have to prove that they are worthy to rule? You might say "Yeah, that's just your own speculation". Well, I know one thing for certain. Jesus expects his disciples to submit to learning and training. Not only that, He may even expect his disciples to aim higher than their natural talent would suggest. Why? Because God called Jesus to be the Ruler of creation, rather than Himself.

In conclusion, I believe God the Father unveiled Jesus in the beginning, summoned from eternity, from a secret place. The Archangel who spoke, "Let there be light!" may have been on the creation stage before Jesus, but that's not important. Jesus was in the wings of the stage so to speak. He came out of eternity, His light and radiance shining gloriously. In support of this reckoning, the Hebrew word for eternity <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5769"><u>H5769</u></a> means “concealed”.

This is important because it is God’s personal testimony to you and me about the way he made the universe, earth, creatures and man. I suggest He is saying “Don’t try to interpret this part … just read it slowly and comprehend the words according to the dictionary.”

For appreciating the glorious account of Chapter 1, God makes a brief summary of His work, saying “These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created”. In terms of the KJV, the Lord God did not say “This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created”. My paraphrase of this sentence is "This is the Lord God's ministry of Creation when they were created". God says "I want you to know about my ministry of genelogy and heritage". This is God's administration design.

Recall that the literal and physical heavens and earth were not created in Chapter 1. The living creature that does the physical creation was made, because that is the design of God. A living creature with all the genius of God inside him is the engineer of a physical creation that happens next. Notice that the Lord God emphatically declares this by saying “and every plant of the field **before it was in the earth**, and every herb **before it grew**: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground”.

I propose that in the beginning, according to nature, the whole earth was covered by a thick rainforest, ranging from mainly tropical to temperate forest at the poles. This meant the atmosphere was saturated by water vapour, 100% humidity. There was no ice on the poles, all land area was covered by rainforest. It was probably hostile to non-aquatic animal life, being 100% humidity. The first animals to come out of the rivers onto land were amphibians like frogs. The first meteor strike would have burned up a lot of vegetation, probably inducing an ice age if the smoke was like a furnace burning for weeks or months continually, and thus blocking the sun’s radiation in the upper atmosphere. When reptiles evolved from amphibians the Lord created dinosaurs. What’s His goal with the dinosaurs? The giant herbivores contributed to a major change in the landscape. Why? I saw a doco once about the influence of elephants next to a forested region. Elephants eat trees and knock down what’s left by their sheer bulk and instinctive behaviour. Herbivore dinosaurs are 10 - 15 times the size of an elephant and have the same instinct - destroy trees. The dinosaurs created the big open spaces of the earth like the great plains of America. 

I am of course suggesting that the Lord God created the flesh of all beasts, birds and reptiles by His intelligent design. This includes the flesh of man. But He created the spirit of man more personally by creating the generations of Man that make the spirit of man by decree of the Lord’s Government in the 2nd heavenly region. It should not matter to the born again person in Christ if God created his flesh by evolution. Why? Because it does not matter in the big eternal scheme of things, such as the resurrection of the dead.

This is all pointing to the real fundamental teaching of the bible. God is not interested in the flesh of Man, He doesn’t judge according to the flesh, He looks at the heart. Yes, God made man and woman beautiful in the beginning when Adam and Eve were in the garden. But we should not glory only about this in our relation to God. We should glory in having a new kind of spirit called Israel when we receive Jesus and belong to Him.
