### **The Eye is the Lamp of the Body - Part 1**

Recall that God made man in His image and likeness. The greatest feature of this likeness is man’s heart and his capacity to dream, conceive and believe. The experience of faith is evidence that we are created in God’s image. Faith is the inescapable design and function of Man’s heart. Non-believers and atheists do not change their heart from belief mode to unbelief mode by their unbelief. Ironically, they just believe that unbelief is justified. But to those who do believe, God says “Now render the flesh of your domain”. What is this domain? The dictionary says “domain is an area of territory owned or controlled by a particular ruler”, which says it ALL. In the heart of man, your domain is the playground or pavilion for ruling and reigning. Recall that Hebrew word <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7607"><u>H7607</u></a> means flesh, and the root verb means to swell. Rendering the flesh means to materialise your vision in the flesh. It’s not a coincidence that to conceive means both to actually and virtually create a new body. The first case means flesh swells in a mother’s womb, creating a new body while the Lord creates a new soul. The second case refers to the grand design of Man’s heart. By the power of vision and faith in man’s heart, virtual flesh swells creating a new body for man to work out his plans.

<subhead><p>Jesus is the Bridegroom</p></subhead>

<bref>Psa 19:1-6 BSB</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> The heavens declare the Glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <bref>2</bref> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night, they reveal knowledge. <bref>3</bref> Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard, <bref>4</bref> their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun <bref>5</bref> Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. <bref>6</bref> It rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.

The voiceless heavenly language includes the encoded laws of the natural universe, such as gravity. Man’s interpretation is mathematics. They also touch the foundations of the earth, the ministry of life generation. See <a target="_blank" href="/bible/exposition/2022/12/24/son-of-man.html"><u>The Son of Man</u></a> article for details. About the bridegroom. There is only one biblical promise connected to “bridegroom”. That is Messiah or Christ.

Looking now to Jesus talking about the “eye that is a lamp”

<bref>Matt 6:22-24 BSB</bref>
.<bref>22</bref> “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. <bref>23</bref> But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then, the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness. <bref>24</bref> No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”

<bref>Mark 4:21-25 BSB</bref>
.<bref>21</bref> Jesus also said to them “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under and a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand?” <bref>22</bref> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light”. <bref>23</bref> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear. <bref>24</bref> He went on to say “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use it will be measured to you and even more will be added to you. <bref>25</bref> For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him”

The Lord says “If anyone has ears to hear let him hear”. I believe He means “Therefore if you have a witness that says ‘If only God would reveal secrets about my personal struggle’ then **pay attention to what you hear**”. 

Prophetic insight that unveils glorious hidden items will rewrite identity records. The Lord says “Glory revealed from the inside will beam out of their faces !”

<bref>Luke 8:16-18 BSB</bref>
.<bref>16</bref> “No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar, or puts it under a bed. Instead he sets it on a stand so that those who enter can see the light. <bref>17</bref> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light”. <bref>18</bref>
“Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him”

The Lord says “If anyone has ears to hear let him hear”. I believe He means “Therefore if you have a witness that says ‘If only God would reveal secrets about my personal struggle’ then **pay attention to how you listen**”

Prophetic insight that unveils glorious hidden items will rewrite identity records. The Lord says “Glory revealed from the inside will beam out of their faces !”

<bref>Luke 11:33-36 BSB</bref>
.<bref>33</bref> “No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead he sets it on a stand so that those who enter can see the light. <bref>34</bref> Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they’re bad, your body is full of darkness”. <bref>35</bref> “Be careful then that the light within you is not darkness. <bref>36</bref> So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.” Or NIV says “as when a lamp shines on you”

God’s word says the “eye” is a fountain. That’s a beautiful way to describe a lamp - a fountain of light. Compare the function of the natural eye to the spiritual eye. The former is passive in that it requires external light and is stimulated by light. The latter is a “light” projector that streams True or False faith pictures into the inner world of man, the body of the heart. Light is not describing the actual thing emitted, it describes the type of thing emitted, whether True or False. The actual things emitted are faith pictures, imagery that either builds up a person in the Truth or tears down a person in the False. Faith is the inescapable default function of Man’s heart.

Read what God says about the heart of man. The Strong’s definition of the verb “labab” says => to be enclosed. I believe this is the core definition of a body or host. A closed system that provides a habitable place, an environment for doing work. The Earth is a closed system in terms of mass but not energy. Without the help of a powerful rocket, and leaving out quantum theory, no person, not even a single molecule can escape the gravity of Earth.

The spiritual eye is an imagery fountain, a fountain of word-pictures that either buildup a person in the Truth, or tear down a person in the False. Identity is influenced by a whole catalogue of diverse things. But only one thing is needed. Light. Jesus Christ is the Light that illuminates the inner world of man. This is a body, because you .. live .. in .. it. **The heart does not live in you, you live in your heart**. The heart is more powerful than even the most enlightened disciple of Jesus could apprehend. I say apprehend, because to imagine is just entry level expertise, apprehending is a much higher level of working knowledge. 

<bref>Proverbs 9:10 NIV</bref>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

<bref>Proverbs 16:11 NKJV</bref>
Honest weights and scales are the LORD’s; All the weights in the bag **are His work**

<bref>Isa 28:23-26 NIV</bref>
.<bref>23</bref> Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. <bref>24</bref> When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil? <bref>25</bref> When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field? <bref>26</bref> His God instructs him and **teaches him the right way**.

The Lord graciously gives inspiration for people to apply knowledge. Without application, of course, there’s no benefit. In the field of academic science things are more intense, God provides inspiration but also the enemy can and does exert influence, especially to stir up rage against the intelligent design of God in the beginning. The world continues for each person according to what they believe. If you believe that wood does not melt, then you limit wood from melting. You might say “What ?! Wood burns .. wax and plastic can melt but wood burns”. 

You might know that atoms are the principal components that constitute all physical matter. Atoms in turn are composed of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons and electrons. Atoms can also be defined in terms of bounded energy. Atomic energy is **enclosed** in a container that just exists. I personally believe science leaves this property alone and ignores it, because it’s potentially touching the virtual realm. Maybe it’s a tiny 3D electromagnetic field that creates a boundary? Apparently not.

Remember that God is the Lord of Hosts. I believe the Lord makes a virtual container, a tiny host that contains the material energy of an atom. It’s interesting that bounded atomic energy defines an atom’s mass density. There’s a whole <a target="_blank" href="/2022/12/28/harmonic-gravity.html">new frontier</a> emerging on this subject, so get excited ! I suggest that if this atomic host is a virtual container then that means wood can melt. Peter's epistle says that when this present creation is eventually destroyed the elements will melt in the process. Imagine it ... all God needs to do to destroy the physical creation is to universally collapse every virtual atomic host. All matter would instantly melt in a huge sea of unbounded energy!

### **The Eye is the Lamp of the Body - Part 2**

How does the spiritual eye “see” the world? Since this internal eye of the heart is a projector of light, **it sees according to faith**. The Light of Christ illuminates the soul with Truth. In this Light, seeing means understanding the gospel of Jesus Christ as Holy Spirit reveals the details. 

<bref>Prov 4:18-19 NIV</bref>
.<bref>18</bref> The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. <bref>19</bref> But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.

<bref>John 11:9-10</bref>
.<bref>9</bref> Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. <bref>10</bref> It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”

In this teaching by the Lord Jesus, what or where is the place that is lit by the “daylight” of Christ? It must be this inner world, where the soul is illuminated by faith. Faith which is either true or false, light or darkness. With the Holy Spirit’s help, we can correctly understand and adopt God’s word as our life pattern. Jesus is the Way to life. He leads on the path of holiness. By adopting His way of life, the saint will not stumble, because there is light to see and the path is not treacherous.

<bref>Prov 8:18 KJV</bref>
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2315"><u>H2315</u></a> of the belly <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H990"><u>H990</u></a>.

<bref>Prov 8:18 NKJV</bref>
The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles, And they go down into the inmost body.

<bref>Prov 8:18 BSB</bref>
The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.

beten, beh'-ten; from an unused root probably meaning **to be hollow**; the belly, especially the womb; also the bosom or body of anything: — belly, **body**, + as they be born, + within, womb
<hr/>
<br/>

The word of God confirms another aspect of the inner body. Not only is it enclosed but it is hollow, which means there is habitable space inside. Like a large mansion, it has as many chambers as there are identity attributes.

When Jesus teaches about the eye, the lamp of your body, he describes the lamp’s position in relation to the soul. First he says “the light within you” and second he says “light that shines on you”. The “light within you” is the lamp of faith, the “sun” of your inner world. The “light that shines on you” points to the soul walking under the sun, in the daylight of Christ or the nightlight of unbelief. I purposely say nightlight since the Lord warns “if the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness”. On the bright side of the believer spectrum, Holy Spirit desires to lead us into all truth. As <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm"><u>Prov 4:18</u></a> says “shining ever brighter till the full light of day”. 

In summary, this lamp projects what you believe into the space of your worldview. This is not a weird “new age” thing that I’m talking about. Worldview simply means “the way you see yourself in the world, as a person with either permission to rule or not". For the saints, it’s not a secret that identity and value are totally shaped by how we relate to God, our Creator. This could be a special witness embedded deep in the spirit and mind of every human. Why? Because as <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-16.htm"><u>Num 27:16</u></a> KJV says, Israel's God is the God of the spirits of all flesh. It’s an inescapable spiritual reality. 

Just because someone is adamantly opposed to faith in Jesus and God, does not mean they can eradicate the super-subtle awareness of their Creator. Awareness that says “you are not designed to be autonomous”. 

This intrinsic worldview casts every person as a potential ruler inside their domain. No one can rule or reign in darkness. The brightness of God’s word depends on how you personally understand and value it. 

Recall <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm"><u>Psa 19:5</u></a> => “Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course”. Jesus is the bridegroom who enters your domain and meets with you. He can reveal secrets. This means by faith we can enter into a holy and personal partnership with Christ to discover the knowledge of God. We can become like Him. Like a champion, rejoicing to run their course.
