The book of Genesis Chapter one is the Lord God's intelligent design document, providing a witness and a picture of heaven and the universe. Without doubt there is a significant challenge presented to the reader in order to to appreciate His witness. Consider that the world of heaven must surely be dramatically different to earth. The obvious contrast is that heaven is not a physical world. The realm of Heaven compared to Earth is like comparing day and night, spirit and flesh. 

How different could it be? Let's hope for inspiration while I make an educated guess! Imagine Heaven is 3 dimensional and "everywhere" while earth is a 2 dimensional "flatland" world controlled by Heaven. The former is true reality while the latter exists by virtue of the former. That is, the universe, earth and mankind exist by virtue of the Lord God of Israel, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. By relative comparison, the natural life of "flatland" is like a projected image moving through time, in the same way a 1950's picture reel moves through the light of a projector.

<bref>Exo 3:14 NIV</bref>
God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”

<bref>Job 33:30 ESV</bref>
To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the **light of life**.

<bref>Psa 27:1 ESV</bref>
Of David. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

<bref>Psa 36:9 NKJV</bref>
For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light.

<bref>Psa 56:13 NIV</bref>
For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the **light of life**.

<bref>Matt 4:6 NKJV</bref>
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death Light has dawned.

Notice that the people in darkness sit in the darkness waiting for dawn, because a person can not work in the darkness.

<bref>John 1:4 ESV</bref>
In him was life, and the life was the light of men

<bref>John 8:12 ESV</bref>
Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the **light of life**.”

<bref>John 12:46 ESV</bref>
I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness

<bref>Luke 6:19 KJV</bref>
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went **virtue** out of him, and healed them all.

The bible helps to promote the "fear of God" which is healthy and good. God says "I AM self-existant", while man can only say "I am breathing by virtue of the Lord God who gives me the light of light". The light of life is the virtue of Jesus.

<bref>Psa 33:6 NIV</bref>
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.

<bref>Psa 33:6 NLT</bref>
The LORD merely spoke, and the heavens were created. He breathed the word, and all the stars were born.

<bref>Psa 33:6 KJV</bref>
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

When the bible says "the Lord created the heavens by the breath of his mouth", it might be easy to assume that God spoke and by supernatural power creation immediately stood up to attention. That's the impression that the NLT version gives, by saying 'the Lord merely spoke'. But if you think about it judiciously, the creative action is defined by an adverb of sorts that adds depth and backgound to the picture. In general, the Hebrew word Ruach can be translated to the english words "wind, breath, spirit", and either refers to a spirit or to naturally occuring wind. Why does Hebrew apply the same word for wind and spirit? Because both wind and spirit animate the flesh. By the convection of solar heat, wind is generated moving the clouds, trees, water and dirt. Without the sun and atmosphere to provide wind life on earth would not exist because wind makes rain possible. It carries warm water vapour into the colder atmosphere creating clouds. Consider that the violence and power of a storm is created by wind currents that can't be held back or controlled. The "breath of God's mouth" is a very important theology statement. It says the Lord God is a person, whose voice is His Word, and breath is His Spirit. This identifies the Trinity. The Father declares His Word (the Son) using His breath (the Spirit) to execute His will. But wait a second, God is spirit !? Breathing is required for flesh but not for Spirit. Ahha ! This is a beautiful analogy that encourages mankind to connect with their maker. The Lord encourages mankind to believe that 1. their image is from God and 2. that their own breath is a gift from God.

It's an analogy because God is spirit, He does not breath. He does not inhale air and exhale breath. It actually means that creation has an Executor, a very powerful person. He is the Holy Spirit. He does the actual work of creating, and He moves only when God's command is declared. Recall that Gen 1:2 says "The Spirit of God hovered over the waters". This means Holy Spirit was getting in position ready for the water, the Word of God, to flow. Like a runner with their posture set to explode forward on the starter's gun. So the idea that God spoke and immediately the earth changed from nothing into a functional planet is not valid. Since nothing is impossible for God, the Lord CAN create something from nothing, but that not what the bible actually records. 

<bref>Heb 11:3 NKJV</bref>
By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were **not made of things which are visible.**

<bref>Heb 11:3 NIV</bref>
By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen **was not made out of what was visible.**

The universe, the things which are seen, were not made of things which are visible. The substance of creation is something, and that something is invisible. What is something invisible that can produce visible matter? The answer must be energy, perhaps not in terms of E = mc^2. It also refers to invisible phyical matter, that is, the atomic elements. There is a really curious idea that proposes an alternate definition of atomic existance. That is, atomic mass depends on a physically undetectable virtual host, provided by the Lord of Hosts! This container converts energy to mass not according to E=mc^2 but according to a statistical energy field of mass existance, which indeed may define Space itself. The term "mass existance" means virtual mass density. Thus, atomic mass might be defined by a probability distribution of mass density inside this tiny container. That is, the constructive interference path of probability wave motion is the path of virtual mass movement. This could explain atomic nucleus particles that exist by the convergence of oscillating waves, intersecting constructively in the center of a spherical host container. Electrons are also created by other waves that harmonically oscillate, converging on the boundary of the container. This wave model is inline with a discrete atomic energy spectrum. That is, in a higher energy state the probabilty wave has a higher frequency, which is always a discrete or quantum multiple of the stable frequency condition. About visualising the atomic nucleus idea. Think of a cyclindrical cup of water with a height to diameter ratio between 1 and 1.5 and filled to 4/5ths of the cup height. If the cup is gently knocked, the water sloshes creating circularish waves that rebound off the walls and converge in the center. The first convergence of circular ripples will create a little ball of water projecting upwards, which for a moment is separate in free space.

<bref>Job 38:4-7 NIV</bref>
.<bref>4</bref>Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me, if you understand. <bref>5</bref> Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? <bref>6</bref> On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone- <bref>7</bref> while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?

<bref>Job 38:7 NKJV</bref>
When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?

The bible calls angels the sons of God. As for the holy angels, the Lord God gives them the privelege of declaring the commands that are entrusted to them. In the first order creation, Arch-angels speak commands for creating worker angels. Later, in the second order creation, worker angels are directed by commander Arch-angels to speak their commands for creating the natural world.

Imagine the scene, kind of like a stage when each of the morning stars has a turn in the spotlight to declare the next creation command. After the natural things appear, an angel or an angel company of the Kingdom is charged to maintain life. That does not mean things are static, quite the opposite. I believe, there is continual warfare in the spiritual heavens designed to uphold or degrade the prosperity of mankind. Each person is pushed and pulled to believe either their eternal identity is real or fake. The consequences of this struggle flow on to affect all of natural life. Realise that Satan and his cohorts hate mankind with a cruel hatred, because if unchallenged the chosen ones of mankind, the ones who overcome by faith in Christ, will eventually supercede the angels and one day start to rule with God, even as the Lord God planned from the beginning. The chosen ones of mankind are Israel, according to the Spirit. This Day of Reckoning happens when the bright Morning Star, Jesus Christ appears at the Resurrection of the dead. 

A feature of God's Word, is the oracle of the Hebrew language. Another feature of God's Word is the descriptive language, a spiritual language that is sometimes strange in contrast to literal and "logical" natural language. This strangeness might be prohibitive for some class-conscious people, whose worldview is limited to "proper" academic information.

For example, the Lord's spiritual language sometimes appears to personify objects and animals, giving them intelligence attributes like a human begin.

<bref>Gen 3:1 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”

This verse is one of the most studied and explored verses of the bible, yet do we really know the "3D picture" of the story. It's not hard to imagine how an authoritive book that personifies animals might influence story tellers throughout history. Books like the Narnia series by T.S Lewis are an example. 

Is God really saying that the beasts of the fields are intelligent? You might say "He means animal cunning, like a lioness crouching in the grass sneaking up on unsuspecting wilderbeast". It's hard not to smile or giggle, thinking how this cunning comparison could be worked out. Imagine some cartoon african herbivores talking about predators. "Well the lion's main weapon is the ambush because of numbers, but the leopard, ugg, he is a deadly night stalker". As a side note about noctural predators, ever wondered why the zebra is marked with black and white stripes? It's not for daylight hours but for camouflage in the night. You might expect, with there exceptional night vision, leopards would clean up stalking at night, especially when moonlight could reveal their prey. Well the black and white stripes work especially well in the moonlight. Because moonlight casts varying shadows, in that space, a pack of zebras become almost invisible.

But seriously, is there something else that does not rely on personified animals? Yes, He is referring to the angels who govern the lifecycle of every animal type and kind. These are the Generations, the living types in charge of life continuity and version control, who rule over the Day and and the Night.

In this story the snake represents Satan, the ruler of Darkness, while Jesus is the Lord of Light. There is a fierce competition between Light and Dark for the right to propogate their seed. In this continuous struggle, the victor of each warfare episode, wins the right to decide what **kind of people** will continue or be culled in the various tribes of man of the world. This struggle is reflected in the earth and described by the term "survival of the fittest".

The bible is not designed for academic scholars to critic. There is only one worldview that can truely perceive and understand Gods prophetic writing. That is, the worldview of the Holy Spirit. This is an amazing gift, it comes from the heart of God, the amazing attibute that makes Man different from other creatures. 

<bref>2 Cor 9:9 BSB</bref>
As it is written: “He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.”

Man is created in the image of God, exclusively because the heart of Man is made just like God's heart. The bible is a spiritual book. That's why the language might sometimes *seem* absurd, because its not for natural consumption. By absurd, I mean if not careful you might believe that before the Fall, talking animals could interact with humans and even plot there downfall. A little humour is always welcome!

<bref>Gen 1:4-5 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>4</bref> And God saw the light <b1>H216</b1>, that it was good; and God divided the light <b1>H216</b1> from the darkness. <bref>5</bref> God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.

What does a Day mean? Is it 24 hours or does it means a stage of work? The literal creationist camp says "there's no hidden meaning, a cosmic day conforms to earth-time because the bible is designed for humans not angels, so let's not confuse the humans". While the intelligent-design camp says "the Day is a stage of work when creatures have opportunity to compete". 

Let's review the interpretation of Light according to Genesis. The Hebrew dictionary generally describes light <b1>H216</b1> as "the light of life", which actually means the condition of **being alive**. This now establishes a logical proof. The light of life, the light of Genesis, is not literal light but spiritual light. Therefore by association a Genesis Day is the period when life prevails continuously, until the Night eventually comes around. So now we can confidently answer the question : What does a creation Day mean? A spiritual Day is simply the **total period of a creature's life**. What if the creature is a Generation, a living type? What is the meaning of life and death for this strange creature? It is the total period that a creature type has custody of its own seed for propogating that seed in the natural realm. Seed capitol is a good analogy, similar to the idea of a bank that can compete only as long as it holds money for investment capitol. A creature kind is related to a creature type as a human person is related to their ancestors. The way that one kind is succeeded by a new kind is, in my vernacular anyway, the Lord God's ministry of version control. Version control is governed by the power of entropy, the power of competition that pursues dominion over rival creatures in the race to avoid extinction. The death of a creature kind, when the Night appears, is not unexpected and not a calamity but the death of a creature type perhaps would be a serious calamity (similar to the failure of a bank). Competition is entropic because it destroys the weakest creature until that weaker seed is annihilated, which destroys the development work and capitol invested in that creature's life. Indeed, destruction of the weakest player is the goal of competition, which as you might expect is actually warfare. It is just one aspect of the Lord's intelligent design that is, I believe intended to be imperfect perhaps so that the real standout players are revealed. See how the Lord God may be challenging your worldview about life in the cosmic realm, in the heavenly realm.

What about Genesis Day one? What kind of creature was created on Day one?

Day one describes the beginning of the God's great plan and purpose of a creating a new age of Kingdom investment. The Lord God of Israel owns the whole universe because of course He made it. He designed it to be used and consumed until every last drop of fuel is burned up and the world is totally worn out. However, the first Day is founded on the cornerstone of Life. In the beginning "darkness (disorder and corruption) was on the face of the deep", which might point to the post-apocalypse state of the previous age. And God said "Let there be Light". Truth is Light and deceit is Darkness. Thus on the first Day, the ministry of creation was setup and established, which is the first act of separating Light from Darkness. The first act of building a foundation was appointing the ruler of creation. The Light of creation is the Ruler of creation, and is Jesus Christ, as declared in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/3/1/t_conc_1170014"><u>Rev 3:14</u>. This Ministry of Creation is itself a living creature, and Day one is when it was born.

Prepare to be stunned by the Glory of God's Word! For each Generation, a Night and Day period represents a creation lifecycle revolution which is a version control iteration and points to the Lord's mastery of metamorphosis. It is a metaphor of natural life, which defines day and night by a revolution of the earth. Hebrew word <b1>H1755</b1> shows how the Jesus has command of creation. Isaiah asks "Who will declare His generation?". Let me paraphrase, "How will life continue to revolve or gyrate?". Comparing Hebrews words <b1>H8435</b1> and <b1>H1755</b1> shows the different activity of a Generation, ie, an order of generating angels, compared to the ruler of creation, Jesus Christ. The oracle of the Hebrew language explains that being Ruler, Jesus is the architect of the foundational clockwork of the universe. That is, gravity and its characterist action of separating clouds of gas and dust and gathering a cluster of dust or gas into a heap, into stars or planets. If you've seen images of cosmic dust and gas gathering into a heap, the attraction of gravity works from the center of mass, working along its field lines that spiral towards the center. This spiraling action also rotates which causes the incoming dust or gas to heap up into a spherical shape. Here is an image of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/hubble-studies-a-spectacular-spiral"><u>Galaxy NGC 1961</u></a>, with beautiful contrasting colors. Notice that the root word of Christ's generation means to gyrate. Since earth was surely created by hot star dust heaping up into a gyrating spheroidal planet, we know exactly what the scripture means concerning a habitation and dwelling place.

Notice again that Isaiah 53:8 says "who will declare his generation?". This verse is voicing concern about the Lord's eternal status, given that He was "cut off" which means put to death. With respect to Jesus as ruler of creation, this means "who will inherit His office and signet ring?". 

<bref>Job 38:14 NIV</bref>
The earth takes shape like clay under a seal (signet ring), its features stand out like those of a garment.

This is an amazing support testimony that refers exactly to the role of Jesus as Lord of creation. The saints of course know the answer to Isaiah's concern : Jesus is the firstborn from the dead, vindicated and seated at the right hand of the Father, high above every other name that can be named. 

Yet another biblical term that reinforces the notion of a spiritual Day is the concept of morning or dawn. There is one special Morning, the spiritual Day called Resurrection of the Dead. Although generally Morning explains the purpose of a transition from Night to Day, because it generally means that relative to the previous Day, the new Day will reveal some degree of metamorphosis that defines a new creature version.

All the following verses give a witness that in the Morning, things will change, people and cities will be transformed. This is the witness about the morning and the purpose of the Day. The Day is a period when life is resident and a creature has opportunity to work. The Night is a time of endurance, waiting for dawn to arrive. It can also be a time of adversity, because obscurity may be imposed on someone by the Adversary of the saints, making their life and their world darkened. In this case, rehersal of life is the only recourse to deal with pain, the pain of wasted time and effort. Rehersal is just like an actor preparing to play a stage role, when the light of life dawns. Rehersal is clinging on to hope that morning is coming around when anticipated changes happen, changes that resonate with the Light of life. Rehersal is about meditating on the Word of God as Joshua 1:8 says "Do not let this Word of God depart from your mouth, meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do all that is written in it, then you will be prosperous and have good success". To observe means to perceive by faith.

<bref>Job 14:14 NIV</bref>
If someone dies, will they live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.

<bref>Job 14:14 NKJV</bref>
If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, till my change comes.

<bref>Isa 26:19 ESV</bref>
Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead.

<bref>Isa 26:19 NLT</bref>
But those who die in the LORD will live; their bodies will rise again! Those who sleep in the earth will rise up and sing for joy! For your life-giving light will fall like dew on your people in the place of the dead!

<bref>Isa 26:19 NASB 1995</bref>
Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew is as the dew of the dawn, And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.

<bref>Isa 26:19 KJV</bref>
Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h5307/kjv/wlc/0-1/"><u>H5307</u></a> the dead <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7496/kjv/wlc/0-1/"><u>H7496</u></a>

This one is an example of how the Hebrew language can produce super interesting hermeneutics (interpretations). The KJV english phrase "shall cast out" refers to <b1>H5307</b1>. The applied Hebrew verb/adverb tense is Hiphil which means the Earth is doing something to the dead. That's fairly obvious from the general theme of this verse, but let's look at how the "giving birth or healing" idea is revealed exactly. For <b1>H5307</b1>, for Hiphil tense, the Hebrew dictionary says "to overthrow" and "to let drop, cause to fail". So we can deduce that the slightly obscure term "to let drop" points to a more concrete term meaning "cause to fail". Next the phrase "the dead" refers to <p1>H7396</p1>. The Hebrew meaning is "ghosts of the dead, shades, spirits". The root verb is actually a combination of two, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7495/kjv/wlc/0-1/"><u>H7495</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h7503/kjv/wlc/0-1/"><u>H7503</u></a>. For <p1>H7495</p1>, the Hiphil tense means "to be healed", while <p1>H7503</p1> means "to let drop, abandon, relax, refrain, forsake". Notice that the term "to let drop" appears first with qualifying verbs following. So the dead are people for whom healing was allowed to drop, allowed to fail. The curious thing is that "in the Morning" the earth overthows that condition by multiplying "to fail" with "to fail" which is a double negative and apparently equals "to succeed"! So the final verdict says the resurrected dead will become people for whom healing is allowed to succeed! 

The resurrection of the Dead, is a day when staggering changes will happen. A new version of life is revealed, for some the life of light and vindication for others the darkness of guilt and judgement followed by the second death which is final and unchangable.

<bref>Isa 51:17 BSB</bref>
Wake yourself, wake yourself, stand up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath, who have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering.

<bref>Isa 52:1 BSB</bref>
Awake, awake, clothe yourself with strength, O Zion! Put on your garments of splendor, O Jerusalem, holy city! For the uncircumcised and unclean will no longer enter you.

<bref>Isa 60:1-2 ESV</bref>
Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the Lord will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.

<bref>Rom 13:11-12 ESV</bref>
Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
