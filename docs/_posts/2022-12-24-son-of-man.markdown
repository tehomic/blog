### **Structure and Rank in the 2nd Heaven**

<bref>Isaiah 40:26 NIV</bref>
Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. 

Here God says He has to intentionally exert his power to prevent the loss of his worker angels. This implies there must be an angelic chain of command and this structure is strong to prevent damage. This is the structure of His heavenly government. This also implies that without God’s protection, Satan could attack, overpower and destroy vulnerable holy angel bands. There may be continual heavenly warfare that is about possessing territory for gaining control in heaven and on earth.

<bref>Matt 8:5-10 NIV</bref>
When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?” The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.

Here Jesus marvels at the Centurion who was virtually saying “I know that you are a King because I’ve seen your chain of command in action”. I suggest that initially he saw Jesus healing the sick, casting out demons and preaching with authority. Then later he must have seen the disciples also working the same miracles as their leader, and rebuking evil spirits with the same authority. He compared how the chain of command works in his world, and by intelligent insight he concluded Jesus must be a King, even greater than Caesar. 

It seems that in raising up Rome as a dominant power, the Lord’s wanted to introduce certain aspects of Roman rule such as government administration. That would also include taxation which, as far as Israel’s history is concerned, was an oppressive overlord activity. Rome was generally ruthless and evil, depending on the current ruler. The use of crucifixion is an appalling abuse of power, but the world was a more barbaric place in the days of Rome.

<bref>Matt 26:53 NIV</bref>
Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?

Jesus uses the term “legion” which was only known as a Roman soldier group at the time. He might have gifted to the Romans his government and military design for human society. The Lord used Rome for his own long term nation building purposes that extended far beyond the Roman period.

### **Life Generation**

<bref>Isaiah 41:4 BSB</bref>
Who has performed this and carried it out, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD—the first and the last—I am He.”

Jesus is the First and the Last, the Ruler of Creation. Genesis chapter 1 describes how Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit progressively created the Living creature, building the vast ministry of creation that would later synthesise the physical universe, stars, earth, flora and fauna.

Genesis 1 does not directly describe the physical elements of the universe, planets and earth. The Generations of the Lord God are the living type of every heavenly body (eg stars) and earth bound creature. They govern the earth bound cycle of life and represent the hierarchy of all type and kind of flora and fauna, ie, the genus and species of all the earth bound living creatures. 

They are called Generations because 1. They indirectly generate the flesh, to make it swell and grow into the shape of its kind. 2. They govern the lifespan and life cycle of the natural creature.

There are several different words rendered as “flesh” in the KJV of Strong’s concordance. One is <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7607"><u>H7607</u></a> for which the root verb <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7604"><u>H7604</u></a> means “to swell”.

I suggest that the prevailing botanical and biological cycle of life model is missing the primary element. Each Generation, each living kind, puts a synthesis program in the seed of the earthly creature. 

So what is a program? Here's what the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/program"><u>oxford dictionary</u></a> says

<r1>Noun</r1>
1. a plan of things that are done in order to achieve a specific result
  * a workout program
2. a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do
  * a sorting program
3. a thin book or a piece of paper that gives information about a concert, play, sports game, etc.
  * a theater program
4. something that is broadcast on television or radio
  * a news or sitcom program
5. a group of classes that lead to a degree : a course of study
  * she enrolled in the teaching program
6. to start doing what others need or want you to do in order to get involved
  * the boss told him that he'd better get with the program if he wants to keep his job.

<r1>Verb</r1>
1. to give a computer a set of instructions to perform a particular action; to create a program
  * he programmed the computer to calculate his monthly expenses and earnings
2. to give a machine a set of instructions to perform a particular action
  * can you help me program my cell phone?
3. to make a person or animal behave or think in a particular way
  * some criminals are programmed to be violent. 
  * instinctive behaviors that are genetically programmed in animals

<bref>Psa 19:1-5 BSB</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands. <bref>2</bref> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. <bref>3</bref> Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard, <bref>4</bref> their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.

Here, David first says "the skies proclaim the work of his hands". He says that the ministry of Creation, the Generations of God, have proclaimed God's glory by installing a virtual program in every type of earthbound creature. By transcending the Spirit and working in the flesh, the glory of God is revealed. Notice that a computer program is a "set of instructions". I suggest that a virtual generator is a set of God's commands for sustaining a creature's life. Recall David's phrase "without a sound to be heard, their voice has gone out into all of the earth". A generator program is silent because it's the encoded command's of God. Consider the human body generator. This virtual program is equivalent to "biological software" that runs in the human genome, the hardware host. Think about that. Every single cell is a little host for generating "software" to run. Of course, each cell is connected to one of more neighbours in a massive 3D human body network. 

Take a typical plant for example. When the seed is in favorable conditions it germinates, and releases a virtual program that synthesises the flesh of the plant. The program is always working to sustain the plant or animal by cell metabolism, etc. When reproduction happens, the program puts itself in the creature’s seed and thus the natural life cycle continues. When the Lord says "the life is in the blood", He means "life generation is in the blood". Think about it. What is the essential metabolic function for life? The answer is "generation of new cells", which happens in the blood or bone marrow.

### **Spiritual Heritage**

Genesis 1:26 says “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness and let them have dominion over all the other creatures that are made (my paraphrase).”

When Elohim says “Let us make man in our image and after our likeness”, it means that an Archangel is repeating the very discourse of the Trinity when they agreed to make Man in the Lord God’s image.

The Lord God gave the administration of Man to the Generations of Man. What’s interesting about the Generation of Man is that unlike other earthbound creatures, man has a spiritual type and heritage. This means the Generations of Man might have two distinct ministries. One is focused on the different regional families and culture of human beings, the natural heritage of man. The other is focused on the spiritual heritage of man or the type of man. Although they have to strategically cooperate, because they are codependent on each other. 

About this spiritual heritage, there might be two branches at the root. One is Flesh and the other is Spirit. Under the first there is a branch of Satan and under the second there is a branch of Christ. Given the spiritual animosity between these tribes, there must be continual warfare in the heavenly realm, according to the desire of the Flesh and Spirit to dominate each other. This is where rebellion against God’s Word has dire consequences, because it directly gives power to the Flesh to dominate and thus people who are doomed to be rebellious multiply in the earth.

<bref>Luke 11:49-51 NIV</bref>
Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’ Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, **this generation will be held responsible for it all**.

Here the Lord is referring to that wicked ministry of Man that is an evil type of Man. The Lord will condemn that Generation, along with its people, at the end of the age.

<bref>Judges 5:14 BSB</bref>
Some came from Ephraim, **with their roots in Amalek**; Benjamin came with your people after you. The commanders came down from Machir, the bearers of the marshal’s staff from Zebulun.

<bref>1 Kings 13:4-6 NIV</bref>
.<bref>4</bref> When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back. <bref>5</bref> Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD. <bref>6</bref> Then the king said to the man of God, “Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored.” So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored and became as it was before.

These two verses give evidence that the northern kings of Israel were rooted in Amalek according to type. The 2nd verse is startling. Even though the king’s hand and arm were shrivelled, he did not “take it to heart” and think about the implications. He did not repent and remove the idolatry. Why? Because he couldn’t do something foreign to his own spiritual root, the root of Amalek. As it says =>

<bref>Prov 14:8 NIV</bref>
The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways, but the folly of fools is deception

Of course, the New Testment speaks about the very same dilemma of Christian life and leadership. 

<bref>Matt 13:24 NIV</bref>
.<bref>24</bref> Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. <bref>25</bref> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. <bref>26</bref> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. <bref>27</bref> “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ <bref>28</bref> “’An enemy did this,’ he replied. “The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’ <bref>29</bref> “’No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. <bref>30</bref> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”

### **Jesus the Son of David and the Lord of David**

<bref>Isaiah 9:6-7 BSB</bref>
.<bref>6</bref> For to us a child is born, to us **a son is given**, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. <bref>7</bref> Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will **reign on David’s throne** and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.

<bref>Isaiah 11:1-2 BSB</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> Then a shoot will spring up from the stump of Jesse, and a Branch from his roots will bear fruit. <bref>2</bref> The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and strength, the Spirit of knowledge and fear of the LORD

<bref>Num 24:16 BSB</bref>
I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come forth from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel. He will crush the skulls of Moab and strike down all the sons of Sheth

<bref>Luke 20:41-44 NIV</bref>
.<bref>41</bref> Then Jesus said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David? <bref>42</bref> David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand <bref>43</bref> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."’ <bref>44</bref> David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”

<bref>Rev 22:16 BSB</bref>
“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.”

There are two parts that our Lord Jesus refers to, saying “If David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?” Both are explained by the duality of Man’s heritage. The first part concerns the spiritual heritage of David. David was a prophet and is a son of God by his spiritual ancestry in Christ. Thus David saw by the Spirit that Jesus is the Lord of lords. The second part concerns how Jesus is David’s descendant. The Holy Spirit produced the flesh of Jesus in Mary’s womb supernaturally. By the Holy Spirit, Jesus inherited Joseph’s natural genealogy, ie, Joseph the husband of Mary and descendant of David. <b1>Rev 22:16</b1> confirms this. Jesus is the spiritual Root of David and the natural offspring of David. What is special about the terms Root, Offspring and Morning Star? I think Root means the root of God’s vine. Salvation comes only through the Root. Jesus says “You can do nothing without me”. The branches are the heritage map of God’s people who are saved by grace. The Offspring refers to Jesus Christ, the legitimate heir of David’s throne, who rules forever and ever ! The Morning Star has two features. The first refers to the same activity of ALL people during their lifetime. That is, they wake up from sleep in the morning. The second refers to a special morning when the dead will rise to meet the Son of God, the Star who calls out “Wake up sleeper!”

<bref>Psalm 17:15 NIV</bref>
As for me, I will be vindicated and will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness.

<bref>Psalm 17:15 NKJV</bref>
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

For the saints, that’s a beautiful verse for holding on to hope!  

### **Jesus virtually died according to the Spirit**

<bref>Isaiah 53:5-9 BSB</bref>
.<bref>5</bref> But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. <bref>6</bref> We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. <bref>7</bref> He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its (her) shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <bref>8</bref> By oppression and judgment He was taken away, and who can recount His descendants? For He was cut off from the land of the living; He was stricken <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H5061"><u>H5061</u></a> for the transgression of My people. <bref>9</bref> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.

<br/>

Most likely this scripture explains why Jesus is called "the Lamb of God", the perfect eternal sacrifice for sin. It's hard to read all the details about this Hebrew word "stricken", knowing that Jesus was perfectly innocent. The Son of God is one brave and tough Hombre ! The detail explains that although a violent blow does wounding, only a touch of condemnation can impart disease or plague. That's an sobering contrast. A violent blow might break a bone but bones can heal. But authorized condemnation is a deadly peril that works spiritually, and leaves the soul utterly defeated.

<bref>Rom 8:1 BSB</bref>
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

<bref>Rom 8:1 NKJV</bref>
There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

On the cross Jesus suffered the same kind of death as a wicked person, because he was the substitute for the wicked. Whatever punishment happens for the wicked happened to Jesus. This means the Lord virtually died according to the Spirit and became the firstborn from the dead. Notice, I did not say “Jesus died spiritually”, since that is the fate of an unbeliever. What do I mean “Jesus virtually died according to the Spirit”. For God’s perfect legal requirement to be satisfied, God destroyed the one attribute Jesus shared with all Mankind. This attribute was the actual root cause of Adam’s original sin. That is, type of spirit. In vindicating Jesus, God condemned the type of spirit he inherited by being naturally born through the womb of Mary. Corruptible Man was condemned and destroyed by God’s perfect justice. God created a new type of Man by justifying Jesus and all who believe in Jesus. Jesus Christ, the Incorruptible Man, became the first born from the dead ! Praise His name! This is why Jesus called himself the Son of Man. 

The Son of Man has a dual meaning. In spiritual terms, the Son of Man means descended from Man according to type. In natural terms, it means born of a woman, one who inherits the first Adam’s spiritual type. Jesus came into the world through the womb of Mary. He humbled himself and entered the world as a regular person. Although by miraculous conception he also came into the world as God in the flesh, the Son of God. So the Lord’s spiritual heritage had two parts. The first part refers to his spiritual ancestry and is called “I Am”. This ancestry is Most Holy and truly regal. The second part is his type of spirit that was inherited from the First Adam, that is, Corruptible Man. So Jesus identified with all Mankind. That’s gloriously humble, don’t you think?

If you still have doubts that this true gospel idea is right, consider what the Hebrew language says about the Son of Man. 

<bref>Daniel 7:13 BSB</bref>
In my vision in the night I continued to watch, and I saw One like the Son of Man <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H606"><u>H606</u></a> coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into His presence.

<br/>
Is the Lord Jesus identifying himself with weak, sick and feeble Corruptible Man? Yes, because Son of Man has a dual meaning. In the natural sense, as one born of a woman, he was identifying with all Mankind. But in the eternal sense, He is identifying with that new type of Man who is incorruptible. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Son of Man = 2nd Adam = firstborn from the dead = Israel of God, incorruptible, according to type. That is quite a few names, but they all refer to this true gospel idea that says “type of spirit is really what matters”. What is the “Israel of God” part referring to? God’s Word says Israel must be a type of man, type of spirit.

<bref>Exodus 4:22 NKJV</bref>
Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Israel <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H3478"><u>H3478</u></a> is My son, My firstborn”’.

<bref>Romans 9: 6-9 NIV</bref>
.<bref>6</bref> It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. <bref>7</bref> Nor because they are his descendants are they Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned”. <bref>8</bref> In other words, it is not the natural children who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. <bref>9</bref>For this was how the promise was stated : “At the appointed time I will return and Sarah will have a son”.

<bref>Romans 9: 6-9 NKJV</bref>
.<bref>6</bref> But it is not that the word of God has taken no effect. For they are not all Israel who are of Israel, <bref>7</bref> nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, “In Isaac your seed shall be called.” <bref>8</bref> That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as the seed. <bref>9</bref> For this is the word of promise: “At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.”

<bref>Gal 6:16</bref>
Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God

Of course, Israel is not literally God’s firstborn so it’s not referring to the natural nation or natural people. It is referring to the type of person, according to the Spirit. The NKJV says "In Isaac your seed shall be called". Here, seed means type of person, type of spirit. But it also applies to natural things. An apple seed represents a type of apple. When someone receives Jesus according to Rom 10:9, they are “born again from the dead” or “born of the Spirit” and they get a new type of spirit = Christ = 2nd Adam = Israel of God. 

<bref>Col 1: 17-19 NIV</bref>
He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the **firstborn from among the dead**, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him

<bref>Heb 1:5 NKJV</bref>
For to which of the angels did He ever say: “**You are My Son, Today I have begotten You**”? And again: “I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a Son”

These two are pointing to Jesus and his Son of Man title. Let me paraphrase Heb 1:5 => "I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me the Son of Man". 

Jesus died as the perfect Lamb of God, a perfect sacrifice for remission of sins in His name. God the Father says to God the Son, "today I have begotten you". This is a perfect example of God's special power, His <a target="_blank" href="/bible/exposition/2022/12/26/virtue.html"><u>Virtue</u></a>. Jesus was virtually raised from the dead. How do we know this is a true and accurate assertion? Because Jesus was raised by the **power of the Spirit** and He was born **according to the Spirit**. He was raised as the first of a new type of Man. A perfect type of Man, Incorruptible Man! 

Last but not least is the way “son of man” is a title also given to several old testament prophets, such as Ezekiel. This is now easy to explain, since we know it’s referring to their spiritual heritage. Their seed is Christ, which means their type of spirit = Christ.

Revelation chapters 7 and 14 refers to a special group of 144000 selected from the tribes of Israel who have the seal of the Lamb and the Father on their foreheads. <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm"><u>Rev 14:4b NIV</u></a> says “These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb”. We know that in terms of an offering, the first fruits are required to be the best. Surely this means that those selected are from the Israel of God, the born again people of Jesus. They are mighty ones, who prevail over persecution, doing great exploits. Victors not victims. They will rule and reign in the new age. 
Also, spiritual heritage explains why there are 12000 from each tribe of Israel. That’s a fun idea … which tribe of Israel is my spiritual heritage? … which tribe of Israel is your spiritual heritage?
