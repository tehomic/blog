When Jesus came into the world, the heart of Israel was longing for justice. However, by reading the Gospels we see that, as a nation, Israel did not desire justice according to God's Holy Spirit. That's not a criticism, as much as it is a factual statement to introduce that very tragic and compelling story. The title of this story is : "Israel, the holy nation who rejected their Saviour". Even the disciples of Jesus did not perceive the Lord's plan and purpose. The gospels record that Jesus point blank told them that He be would be killed then rise again. The meaning was hidden from them, they did not understand what He meant. That sounds strange, given that no-one could misunderstand what literal killing implies. But what if they thought that Jesus meant a spiritual death and not literal death. Imagine the questions among the group - "Do you think He means ... literally killed ... or spiritually killed?. What does spiritual death mean anyway !?". Rising from the dead is not so obvious, but the verb "rise" is sort-of explained by the following term "from the dead". If you are dead then you're down and out! The bible even says that "all departed spirits go down to Sheol". Being faithful believers, they probably reckoned that since Jesus is their Holy Messiah, He's exempt from going down to Sheol. So "rising from the dead" means He goes straight up to Heaven, but is never seen again "in the flesh". Without the Holy Spirit, no-one could have anticipated the Lord's resurrected body. A supernatural body of flesh and bone but without one feature that defines mortality - that is, blood. 

Notice that the scripture says "the meaning was hidden from them". So "rising from the dead", this idea was hidden. What part of their perception faculty was missing or inactive? Consider that their worldview was vastly different compared to Jesus. Jesus said many things that left his disciples speechless, sometimes with one eyebrow lifted. "Why does worldview have any relevance?", you might say. Because perception is actually a faulty of light.

<bref>Eph 5:13-14</bref>
.<bref>13</bref> But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible <bref>14</bref> for anything that becomes **visible is light**. Therefore it says 'Awake O sleeper, and arise from the dead and Christ will shine on you'.

The bible says whatever becomes visible is light. In terms of natural sight, everything visible reflects light and when that light touches the retina in your eye it is rendered as visible. For spiritual perception, whatever you accept and believe becomes light and is visible for you personally. Where is it visible? In the world where you live under the sun. The sun is your lamp of 'truth' according to your own standard of 'truth'. This is a faculty of man's heart, which is made in the image of God. See the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/bible/exposition/2022/12/29/eye-and-lamp.html"><u>The eye and the lamp</u></a> blog post for more on this subject. About the power of Man's heart. The heart does not live in you, you live in your heart. The world as you believe and perceive it, is created by your spiritual heart. Therefore, how you see yourself in the world, affects what you can accomodate. New 'truth' ideas have to find a space and place and may have to complement an existing feature of your world. I say 'truth' because each person is responsible to decide what is truth and what is untruth.

Jesus came into the world at just the right time for the true believers of Israel. They were humble and hungry for real bread and water. For the proud ones, they just hated being powerless. They craved power, hating the image of their low estate, hating the high estate of Rome. I say image, because pride has contempt for weakness. Yet the weakness of God is stronger than men and the foolishness of God is wiser than men (1 Cor 1:25). 

Jesus came into the world when a spiritual leader who advocated non-violent pursuit of God's Kingdom was actually not welcome by the majority in Israel. The hope of resurrgence for Israel was based on the established Jewish belief that the Son of David would be born in the image of David himself. That is, a mighty man of war who destroys the enemies of Israel. Does that desire spring from a pure motive? It might be that the elites of the day, the Saducees bitterly resented the God of Israel for not providing deliverance. So they justified adopting a 'whatever it takes' political mindset that accepted idolatry if it purchased power and authority. The bible calls this attitude Whoredom. Of course, this mindset actually belongs to Roman culture, the 'world power' culture. Although ironically, the Lord God is not opposed to military force (the Sword), as the bible records. A wise man in the days of Greek and Roman rule might have said 'If only the leadership of Israel would submit to God and do His will then military force will happen when the time is right.' The Maccabean Revolt might be an example.

<bref>Isa 53:7</bref>
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.

Being influenced by the Son of David story, the man of war narrative, the Lord's disciples were not expecting the Lamb of God. Jesus challenged their worldview by predicting his death and resurrection. He exposed the smallness of their heart by revealing the important things of God and His Kingdom. That's a true witness regardless of generation and time. The true disciples of Jesus have to expand their heart so that it might be filled with His Truth. It's fair to say that, initially the disciples did not rightly appreciate the Lamb of God prediction. Consider the Messianic account of Isaiah 53:7 describing the Lamb. Indeed, you have to wonder if this Word was part of their Jewish education. So what is the key to understanding real justice according to Jesus? It is found by doing the Lord's will.

<bref>Psa 40:6 BSB</bref>
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened. Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require.

<bref>Heb 10:5 BSB</bref>
Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but **a body** You prepared for Me.

This Hebrew's verse is referring to messianic <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm"><u>psalm 40:6</u></a>, and I believe Holy Spirit is confirming that a body is God's arrangement to serve Him. For Jesus, it meant coming into the world in the days of the Roman emperor Augustus. This emperor ordered a census that required Joseph to travel to his home town of Bethlehem. This event arranged the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, as foretold in the scriptures. 

<bref>John 4:34 BSB</bref>
Jesus explained, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work."

Accepting God’s arrangement means accepting God’s will instead of our own. There is only food in **doing** the will of God. In this way of submission, we eat the flesh of Jesus and drink his blood. We eat the living bread. 

For each disciple of Jesus, the virtual body is God's arrangement of their world. This body provides everything needed to serve God. See the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/bible/exposition/2022/12/26/virtue.html"><u>Virtue?</u></a> blog post for more on this subject. How does serving God connect with real justice? How does not serving God connect with injustice? 

<bref>Matt 10:16-18</bref>
Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles.

<bref>1 Peter 4:12–14</bref>
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.

These scriptures warn that persecution will happen for those walking in obedience and serving Jesus. Satanic forces work against the Saints to minimize their productive service. Satanic forces can attack the person, their arrangement or both. If the virtual body is attacked and injured, this means God's original assignment is interrupted or reduced. The ultimate goal of Satanic interference is to eliminate the person or their assignment. Persecution can push the Saint out of their mainline ministry towards the periferal sidelines. In this condition, the person is marginalised. Their connection to life and active service is weakened.

A marginalised person suffers death because their **body is destroyed**. The virtual body is the host of their real life. Imposing a limited or cut-off arrangment for serving God is the goal of Satan's persecution plague. Unfortunately, some disciples succumb to the fear of living without real job security and forsake serving God. However, the Lord knows how to deliver from death. If one door closes, another will open according to God's grace. Consider the apostle Paul. He was persecuted and chained as a criminal by enemies of the Gospel in order to restrict his movement. Although, by an abundance of grace for opportunity, his ministry continued to bear fruit. It's different if a Saint is called to be a professional who depends on having direct contact with the secular world. Unless the Saint walks in the Lord's grace and wisdom they may be vulnerable to attacks which directly target their employment. In natural life, the definition of death is the state of heart and body failure. When the body fails death has replaced life. It is the same in spiritual life, when the virtual body fails, death has replaced life. Be aware that imposed spiritual death is a plague and not the absolute condition. When a Saint serves God faithfully and is persecuted such that they bear wounds and share in the sufferings of Jesus they are blessed.

<bref>Matt 5:10-12 BSB</bref>
.<bref>10</bref> Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <bref>11</bref> Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. <bref>12</bref> Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

The Satanic plague of extreme persecution is to spiritual life as disease is to natural life because it robs the person of their real identity and life purpose. This is virtual death because it denies real life from happening. Of course the upper limit of plague and affliction is actual death which happens if a disciple of Jesus is killed in the line of duty.

Another vivid biblical witness about the virtual body is found in Daniel 7. Here is an excerpt from the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/bible/exposition/2022/12/26/virtue.html"><u>Virtue?</u></a> blog post.

<bref>Dan 7:5 BSB</bref>
Suddenly another beast appeared, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. So it was told, ‘Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!’

For tearing up flesh, "three ribs in its mouth" could mean a set of three fangs on each side instead of just one fang. Like a rib or tusk, these fangs are thick and powerful. However, that's just explaining the degree of power for spiritual intimidation. The beast will not literally devour people like a man-eating lion, but will terrorize mainly the saints of Jesus Christ. The mark of the beast is an economic law designed to extort idolatry from all peoples of the world. That is, unless you worship the beast you can’t do business or be employed. That’s extortion. Related to this evil rulership, the beast’s mission is to devour the flesh of God’s assignment for each of his saints. To virtually devour means to stop or block a person from doing their divine assignment. God's arrangement is this virtual body. Being full of grace, the body empowers the saints to do great exploits. It empowers because it gives a Divine licence to operate. By their great exploits the saints escape the mark of the beast as it says in Rev 15:2 =>

<bref>Rev 15:2a BSB</bref>
And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name. They were holding harps from God,

If the disciples of Jesus suffer persecution then of course Jesus suffered the same first. It's possible Jesus was occasionally blocked or stopped by Satanic interference but I'm not sure. For example, when travelling by boat to the Gadarenes region, a ferocious squall attacked the boat. The disciples were terrified that the boat might sink and woke Jesus, who calmly dismissed the wind and waves. 

<bref>John 15:20</bref>
Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master'. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.

One thing that is remarkable is the Lord's attitude in dealing with lies and accusations. Never once did He actually rebuke the lies of the Pharisees, except for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Like at the passover feast before his trial, when his audience said in unbelief "When the Messiah comes no-one will no where he is from, yet this man is from Galillee", Jesus could have said "I was born by the virgin birth that Isaiah predicted. Why don't you investigate your claims before accusing!". And when the Pharisees said "We know where the Messiah should come from, but the law does not say anything about a prophet from Galillee", Jesus could have said "I was born in Bethlehem, according to the scriptures. You know this, yet you broadcast lies!". Yes, in that period this fact was knowable because the Romans did a census. Therefore, the Lord's birth should be recorded especially if Jesus was born before Joseph gave account to the government. There actually is a scripture that points to a prophet from Galillee, in <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm"><u>Isaiah 9:1-2</u></a>. In doing so, by allowing the public to have reason to reject Him as Messiah, Jesus fulfilled the will of God. He did all this to maximise the cause for His rejection so that He would have unimpeded transition to the cross and his death. That's a mind boggling degree of dedication and courage. He used the work of Satan against Satan himself. Jesus the Mighty man of war was setting a day of reckoning against His Arch-enemy. That day of disaster came on Satan's head like a steel trap! That is, when Jesus rose from the dead, He did so having been justified by God's judgement in review of His death. For every single human death there must be a legal process of judging the person's fate, an accounting of their life on earth. For every person before Jesus, if the person was considered blameless they would pass over to <sup><a href="https://tehomic.github.io/blog/bible/exposition/2024/01/31/the-darkness-of-death.html#note-one">[1]</a></sup>Abraham's company which I suppose is like upper Sheol otherwise they go to lower Sheol or Hell. In that process, even if Satan directly orchestrated the death of a person, apparently Satan was not immediately liable to give an account for destroying life. Why? Because even for a blameless person, they have a record of sin and the penalty for even one sin is death. However in the special case of Jesus, here was a precedent that God had desired and planned. In this case, Satan is liable because he orchestrated the death of an absolutely innocent person. One who did not commit even one sin. Now the tables are turned and Satan is counter-charged with 1st degree murder! John's gospel gives a clue about this legal strategy of God against Satan.

<bref>John 19:11 ESV</bref>
Jesus answered him, "You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin."

The greater sin belonged to the chief priests and Pharisees, but the ultimate orchestrator and accuser is Satan who caused the trial and verdict by the malevolent flood of Sin working in human hearts.

What happens next? 
The counter-charge of murder succeeds by overwhelming evidence that accounts for spiritual interference and its overriding influence. That is, the evil work of the malevolent Flood is brought into the light of God's judgement. The verdict is : Guilty!

What happen next is a mystery. 
My unction is this : a warfare encounter is arranged by the Lord God. A day of Reckoning is decreed, when Jesus and his army clash with Satan and his army to prove who is worthy to take their place as Prime minister of the Earth. This person has jurisdiction of the earth and mankind. The original elected one was the first Adam but he lost that title to Satan by eating the forbidden fruit and falling from grace.

Ironically, Jesus really is the Mighty Man of war that Israel wanted but did not recognise. Yet not in the natural but in the Spirit. Actually, the bible supports the idea that a battle was fought, with the armies of Light triumphant over darkness.

<bref>Col 2:14-15 ESV</bref>
.<bref>14</bref> by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. <bref>15</bref> And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.

In bronze and iron age history, warring tribes fighting for territory were ruthless in victory. The Roman way of military conquest and celebration was public humiliation of the defeated opponents, especially the high ranking officers. After the display and mockery were done, the opponents were put to death.

The Lord God's great plan for Jesus to enter the world, create the church, then leave the world is very special and holy. We know that Jesus is the prophetic Lamb who is a perfect sacrifice, providing His own blood for the forgiveness of sin and even remission of sin. The significance of Jesus the Lamb is very great but also not fully revealed. For example, why did Jesus cry out "my God my God why have you forsaken me?". The new testament says He became sin on the cross, bearing all the sin of mankind. Therefore, in that experience Jesus was truely alone without the presence of God in His heart. Thus He was forsaken.

In the original exodus story, when God saw the blood on the door posts and lintel, He passed over that house, and did not enter into judgement with Israel. Instead He judged against Israel's oppressor, both Pharaoh and the whole nation of Egypt, by destroying their firstborn. The Lord gave Israel favour to plunder the Egyptians, awarding back-payment for the years that were stolen. But the Lord had more judgement to do. At first Moses lead them out of Egypt by the only possible way, the land route that runs along the edge of the Mediterranean sea. The Lord directed Moses to make a detour, gathering the people at the edge of the Red sea. Why? To get fame, glory and recognition among all nations, that He alone is the Most High God. He acted graciously to Israel by standing with them in judgement, as their advocate and protector against the gods of Egypt. The pillar of cloud and fire is God's presence showing the people that He was actively helping to overthrow the tyranny of Sin. The Red sea represents the Satanic gods of Egypt. A belligerent Flood of malevolent opposition that arrogantly sets itself against the Lord's plan and purpose. How do the gods of Egypt have such influence that compels the Most High to intercede for Israel? Because the waters represent evil indoctrination that binds a slave to never depart from a slavery mindset. As the saying goes about addiction and slavery : "you can take a slave out the World but how can the World come out of the slave?". Only by a new creation and the Holy Spirit living inside. Back to exodus. So the Lord's final judgement is against the spiritual pollution of Sin. Parting the waters and drying the ground represents God's grace for justifying the believer and removing their record of sin. The dry ground also represents heart restoration for rebuilding a new identity according to God's love.

Now back to Jesus, the perfect sacrifice and substitute for sinners. The key to apprehending subtitution and God's wrath in judgement is this : the substitute does not inherit the status of the sinner. The perfect law of the Lord God requires a substitute to provide his soul for punishment on behalf of the sinner and that is all. So how would the Lord exact punishment on a sinner? It must be according to the record of the sinner's life of sin.

<bref>Matt 6:22-24 ESV</bref>
.<bref>22</bref>The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, <bref>23</bref> but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! <bref>24</bref> No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money

See <a target="_blank" href="/blog/bible/exposition/2022/12/29/eye-and-lamp.html"><u>The eye is a lamp</u></a> blog post for more on this subject. The second key to better understand punishment for sin is this : Spirtual death is a plague that goes on after death for the sinner. Is that fair? Is the Lord God just in allowing that? This is the key to God's justice. The sinner is counted as one who according to type was aligned with Sin. In the period of natural life, the plague of spiritual death passed over them in search of the Saints of Jesus or the nation of Israel. In fact, the true sinner is always available to Sin as a member of the Beast. The Beast is the hands and feet of Satan, working against the Saints, attacking the virtual body, inflicting stripes and wounds if possible.

As for the sinner they choose to accept the testimony of Sin as truth for them. In the darkness of deceit, the sinner accepts an image of their place and standing in the world through the dirty lense of Sin. For example, consider aggressive atheists who openly attack Jesus and the church. Their standard of 'truth' is a perverse imagination, exalting itself against the knowledge of God. These people worship the god of man, they love their own image. So then, what would be a fair punishment for lovers of self? More self-imagery of course, but without the veil of untruth that hides the corruption of Sin. The bible explains that the sinner's soul is tormented by an aggressive adversary whose desire is to stamp their face with 'ugly and hideous' features. These features are the marks of low estate. All the terms and conditions of 'low estate' is according to lies that the sinner accepted as 'truth' while living in the light of life. See the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/bible/exposition/2022/12/26/virtue.html"><u>Virtue?</u></a> blog post for more on this subject.

What about the One who is a substitute for sinners, who bears the punishment for sin? Did He experience the plague of spiritual death on behalf of sinners? My unction says yes. Be aware and remember that imposed spiritual death is a plague and not the absolute condition for a righteous man. Is there a feature of God's plan and purpose that complements the punishment that Jesus experienced? Yes, the Word of God says the Lord is the Judge of the living and the dead. This means Jesus must have experienced the plague of death in order judge the dead rightly. 

<bref>Rom 7:22-24 ESV</bref>
.<bref>22</bref> For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, <bref>23</bref> but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. <bref>24</bref> Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?

My unction is this: While on the cross, Jesus **virtually** experienced a death plague according to Romans 7:22-24, which describes a righteous man who desires to do good. But the commandment of God, although good, gives him no power over sin. Sin is the overlord who commands him how to act, imposing to contradict the law. Of course, the Lord God has control of limits for Sin to impose behaviour. By the Lord God's command of Virtue, the Lord Jesus might have virtually lived for years as a regular jewish person, serving God without the Holy Spirit inside. He lived under the law of Moses, rather than under the banner of God's grace. In doing so, He knows the treachery of Sin and the misery of its influence. This is why He is the good Judge of the living and the dead. This is why, while hanging on the cross, he cried out "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?".

### **Notes**

<ol>
  <li id="note-one">Abraham's company : the place where the soul of a blameless person goes after death. 

  The KJV calls it "Abraham's bosom". About the location that I called Upper Sheol. Ater the resurrection of Jesus Christ and His assession to the Father, Abraham's company, the spirtual place migrated from Sheol to Christ's Kingdom. It became a place or territory in the heavenly "country" of Christ's Kingdom. By connection with the place, the people in Upper Sheol, must have also migrated to heaven. When a faithful Christ believer dies, they immediately go to be with Jesus in heaven. Abraham's company seems to be a special place where new arrivals get an introduction to the majesty of Jesus Christ and His eternal Kingdom.
