### **Virtue is His Signature**

<bref>Mark 5:30 KJV</bref>
And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?

<bref>Luke 6:19 KJV</bref>
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all

<bref>Luke 8:46 KJV</bref>
And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.

<bref>2 Peter 1:3 KJV</bref>
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.

It is well known that the NT Greek word “dunamis” is translated by the KJV as virtue. The KJV translators correctly decided not to associate the natural application of “dunamis” with the Lord’s power. The natural meaning of “dunamis” is explosive power which does not adequately describe God’s spiritual power.

The meaning of virtue by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dictionary.com/virtue"><u>www.dictionary.com</u></a> which matches <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/virtue"><u>www.collinsdictionary.com</u></a> is  =>

1. moral excellence; goodness; righteousness
2. conformity of one's life and conduct to moral and ethical principles; uprightness; rectitude.
3. a good or admirable quality or property
4. effective force; power or potency:

<r1>Origin</r1>

1175–1225; alteration (with i from Latin ) of Middle English vertu from Anglo-French, Old French from Latin virtūt- (stem of virtūs ) “maleness, worth, virtue,” equivalent to vir “man” (see virile) + -tūt- abstract noun suffix

<r1>Vir - latin noun for man</r1>

The meaning of Vir by en.wiktionary.org =>

1. man in the sense of "adult male human": adult, mature or grown man
2. brave or courageous man, hero, warrior
3. husband
4. (military) foot soldier

The meaning of virtual by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dictionary.com/virtual"><u>www.dictionary.com</u></a> which matches <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/virtue"><u>www.collinsdictionary.com</u></a> =>

1. being such in power, force, or effect, though not actually or expressly such
2. temporarily simulated or extended by computer software
3. existing, seen, or happening online or on a computer screen, rather than in person or in the physical world
4. Old-school / archaic =>
capable of producing an effect through inherent power or virtue

<r1>Origin</r1>

First recorded in 1350–1400; Middle English, from Medieval Latin virtuālis, equivalent to Latin virtu(s) “maleness, worth” + -ālis adjective suffix; see virtue, -al1
<hr/>
<br/>

It’s curious and thought provoking that the adjective “virtual” is literally derived from the noun “virtue”. It’s also curious that virtue describes an ideal man, a brave warrior who does heroic exploits. Also means a husband, but also a bridegroom to the next generation that have not yet learned about him. This ideal man is Jesus Christ !

<bref>Psa 22:30-31 NIV</bref>
Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord. They will proclaim his righteousness, declaring to a people yet unborn: He has done it!

What is also interesting is the comparative meaning of virtual and equivalent.

The meaning of equivalent by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/equivalent"><u>www.collinsdictionary.com</u></a> is =>

1. equal or interchangeable in **value, quantity, significance**, etc
2. having the **same or a similar effect** or meaning

<r1>In mathematics =></r1>

3. having a particular property in common; equal
4. (of two equations or inequalities) having the same set of solutions
5. (of two sets) having the same cardinal number
<br/>

Compare the first meaning of “virtual” to the first meaning of “equivalent”. I’ll paraphrase to show the similarity => being such in power, force, or effect, though not actually. That is, having the **same value or effect**, but not actually equal objects. This matches the meaning of equivalence. 

The distinction between “equivalent” and “virtual” might be that virtual implies there is a naturally indiscernible power that produces the effect or result.

<bref>Mark 4:26-28 BSB</bref>
Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.
Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how. All by itself the earth produces a crop — first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within. And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come.”

Note that the gospel even says (my paraphrase) "He knows the grain will appear, **though he doesn’t know how**". 

So the Lord is illustrating that as far as the farmer is concerned, the earth virtually produces a grain harvest. There's something in the background creating the head of grain, but he doesn’t know or care, he just gives thanks that God knows. 

Although ironically, the Lord HAS told him how the harvest appears, the Generation of Wheat or whatever seed he planted is the living program that generates a ripe head of grain. Notice also that by this parable Jesus declares "My Virtue is what my Kingdom is like"

<subhead><p>Why is it important to acknowledge God’s Virtue</p></subhead>

God’s supernatural power, His Virtue, is His signature. It’s the primary way we understand that God is holy, special and awesome. Did you know that for our benefit He allows us to feel or discern his power, like in corporate worship? His power, his virtue, may not be discerned at all if He chooses. 

The Lord’s power is or should be correctly called Virtue because He may withhold a physical sensation that His power is doing any work, but of course, the work is accomplished nonetheless. 

For example, the Holy Spirit may do His sanctifying work so that we are changed from glory to glory, without noticing **until** someone might say to us “Hey, you’re different ! You’re not as impatient as you were before”. Or we might see positive changes that Holy Spirit brings to our attention and we immediately celebrate that God has fulfilled His promise. So, we are now more confident than ever that what the Lord started He is faithful to complete.

I remember one time I was asked to present a short bible study to my connect group. This was the first time I thought about presenting this subject to other disciples. When I did my research, at that time I decided not to focus on the latin roots of the word Virtue. I tried to find a Greek word or syllable that was equivalent to “virtual” in meaning. 

In my mind, the Greek word “cyber”, was similar to “virtual”. From “cyber”, come the modern English words “cyberspace”, “cybercrime”, “cyberbullying” and “cybersecurity”.

Further google searching came up with the Greek word kubernao which means “steer a ship” and kubernetes means “steersman”, having synonyms like “captain” or “pilot”. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35765276"><u>This article</u></a> gives a great historical account of how “cyber” was adopted into English.

<r1>Here is an article excerpt =></r1>

“The normal Latin transliteration of kubernetes gives us "cybernetes" - though practical seafaring Romans worried less about the rules and turned kubernao into guberno, from which we get "govern".
Plato used "kubernetika" to mean skill in steering, and in the 1940s the American mathematician, Norbert Wiener, **derived from it** "cybernetics" to mean "control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal.””

About the origins of English word “govern”, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/govern"><u>www.etymology.com</u></a> agrees with the previous article =>

<r1>Govern (v.)</r1>

late 13c., "to rule with authority," from Old French governer "steer, be at the helm of; govern, rule, command, direct" (11c., Modern French gouverner), from Latin gubernare "to direct, rule, guide, govern" (source also of Spanish gobernar, Italian governare), originally "to steer, to pilot," a nautical borrowing from Greek kybernan "to steer or pilot a ship, direct as a pilot," figuratively "to guide, govern" (the root of cybernetics). The -k- to -g- sound shift is perhaps via the medium of Etruscan. Intransitive sense from 1590s. Related: Governed; governing.
<hr/>
<br/>
It’s curious that this Greek equivalent adds weight to the idea that the Lord Jesus governs the earth like a steersman, a captain, navigating a leaky ship (because of Sin) through the heavenly waters, towards the port and destiny of this creation, where it will finally dock (the end of the age) at the ship graveyard where all the decommissioned ships get demolished.

Another word derived from “kubernao” is “kubernesis”, <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/G2941"><u>G2941</u></a> which means governing or government. It appears in the NT =>

<bref>1 Cor 12:28 BSB</bref>
And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, and those with gifts of healing, helping, administration <b1>G2941</b1>, and various tongues.

### **The Virtual Body**

The church of Christ is the body of Christ, his hands and feet on the earth. The Lord protects his body and nourishes it. Through real life experience, the body is occasionally wounded in battle. He also punishes the body if it willfully rebels and sins against him. Thankfully, He is ready to heal wounds and cause growth when sin and infection is removed.

In this section I’m not referring to the “body of Christ” even though it is the Lord’s virtual body. I’m referring to the flesh of his plan and purpose.

What does the bible have to say?

Let’s go back to a time long ago … back to the old testament !

The God of Israel has many titles including the Lord of Hosts

The Hebrew definition of “host” is “army”, so a common interpretation says God is the Lord of Armies. This is partially true. However, an army is always a host but a host is not always an army. That is, an army is just one type of host among many other types.

The bible says that the angels are called the host of heaven, and represent the stars of heaven. In regard to creation, the narrative says that God created the stars “in their heavenly array”. We know that angels have different roles. There must be a structure and hierarchy in the assembly of angel bands.

Could the distinguishing arrangement of a host define its type? God created the stars “in their heavenly array”. The Hebrew word for “host”, strongs number <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6635"><u>H6635</u></a>, means =>

About the Hebrew word for “host” being defined as a mass of things and an army that is arrayed in ranks and battalions. Depending on the subject, the proper way to interpret a “mass of things” might be a 3D arrangement of units or cells, rather than randomness.

This supports the general meaning of host as a body. Eg, a typical planet in the cosmos is really a mass of stardust and the human body is a mass of cells. More specifically, a human body is **literally a 3D arrangement of living cells**. 

About planets apparently always having a spherical shape. I’ve seen an astro-physics documentary showing a celestial body in the process of forming. Spiralling streams of stardust directed by gravitational field lines. The spiralling action of gravity adds layers of stardust to the planet. This shows the very clever way gravity in action produces a spherical shape. This is God’s design to create a host of life such as the Earth .

In astronomy and also in popular science, the term “host” is not often used to describe stars, planets or systems. The term “heavenly body” is defined by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=heavenly+body+meaning&oq=heavenly+body+meaning&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l9j0i22i30.5912j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"><u>Oxford dictionary</u></a> as “a planet, star, or other celestial body”. Therefore, the meaning of “host” and “body” are synonymous.

### **A Body is required for work**

What is the first prerequisite for doing work? 

Energy? … Oxygen? … Motivation?

The first prerequisite for doing work is a host or body. We may think that energy ingested into our body is the answer because arrangement is so obviously needed that subconsciously it is not considered. Your physical body is not the right answer, but is a valid answer. 

The place, space or environment where work happens is the first requirement and imperative before any work can happen. 

Even angels need a place or a space to work. A purpose and vision always requires some kind of arrangement. The owner of a place, space and environment arranges it *IN* a particular way *FOR* a particular purpose. 

By this definition, God’s purpose and hosting are always linked together.

<bref>Prov 29:18 BSB</bref>
Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the law.

### **Living Clothing - Part 1**

Another interesting but sombre aspect of the cross was the experience of Jesus as he fulfilled all the prophecies declared about the Lamb of God.

Two of those prophecies may be connected.

<r1><p>The first is =></p></r1>

<bref>Isaiah 53:5-9 BSB</bref>
.<bref>5</bref> But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. <bref>6</bref> We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. <bref>7</bref> He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its (her) shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <bref>8</bref> By oppression and judgment He was taken away, and who can recount His descendants? For He was cut off from the land of the living; He was stricken for the transgression of My people. <bref>9</bref> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and **with a rich** <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6223"><u>H6223</u></a> **man in His death**, although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.

Here the Hebrew word for “rich”, <b1>H6223</b1>, is literally a wealthy person. What’s interesting is the way God leaves a breadcrumb trail to discover what exactly happens to the “rich” in death.

<bref>Psalm 49:6-7, 13-14 BSB</bref>
.<bref>7</bref> They trust in their wealth and boast in their great riches. <bref>8</bref> No man can possibly redeem his brother or pay his ransom to God. <bref>9</bref> For the redemption of his soul is costly, and never can payment suffice, 10 that he should live on forever and not see decay … <bref>13</bref> This is the fate of the self-confident and their followers who endorse their sayings. <bref>14</bref> Like sheep they are destined for Sheol. Death will be their shepherd. The upright will rule them in the morning, and their form will decay in Sheol, far from their lofty abode

<bref>Psalm 49:14 NKJV</bref>
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; Death shall feed on them; The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6697"><u>H6697</u></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6736"><u>H6736</u></a> shall be consumed in the grave, far from their dwelling.

The two Hebrew words rendered as “beauty” both point to the same root word <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6696"><u>H6696</u></a>, so I’ll only expand <b1>H6736</b1>.

<r1><p>The second is =></p></r1>
<bref>Isaiah 52:14 BSB</bref>
Just as many were appalled at Him—His appearance <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H8389"><u>H8389</u></a> was disfigured beyond that of any man, and His form was marred beyond human likeness—

<br/>

<bref>Psalm 49:14b BSB</bref>
The upright will rule them in the morning, and their **form** <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6697"><u>H6697</u></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6736"><u>H6736</u></a> **will decay in Sheol**, far from their lofty abode.

<bref>Isaiah 52:14 BSB</bref>
Just as many were appalled at Him—His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man, and His **form** <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H8389"><u>H8389</u></a> **was marred beyond human likeness**—

Consider the two sections of bold text “their form or beauty will decay in Sheol” and “his form or appearance was marred beyond human likeness”. The meaning of <b1>H6736</b1> says beauty in terms of an image or idol.

The meaning of <b1>H8389</b1> says appearance, referring to literal physical appearance. 

One instance of <b1>H8389</b1> is NKJV scripture is <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-17.htm"><u>Gen 29:17</u></a> => Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.

What’s even more curious is that the respective root verbs of each word are partially matching. <b1>H6696</b1> says => <r1>to form, fashion, delineate</r1>. Notice that other meaning items say => to show hostility to, be an adversary, treat as foe; to shut in, besiege. Compare this to <b1>H8388</b1> => to be drawn, incline, <r1>delineate; to draw in outline</r1>, trace out.

The term “their beauty will decay in the grave” is not referring to the literal body, because an arrogant person’s self-confidence is actually an illusion, an image. Beauty that might have defined their self-confidence while breathing is now revealed in the grave as a fraud. The punishment seems to be the presence of a hostile foe that has one goal - to destroy their beauty by binding them in a press and maliciously disfiguring their face. With every press of the image stamp the image becomes more hideous.

In connection with punishment that is spiritual not physical, notice that the <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm"><u>Isa 52:14</u></a> says "his form was marred beyond human likeness". This indicates that due to bearing God's wrath, our brave Lord's appearance on the cross was virtually rendered not human but rather goulish. This also suggests, to a lesser degree, that "identity disfigurement" could happen to anyone who accepts a "guilty verdict" and comes under condemnation. The punishment may not manifest in the face, but will inflict some kind of identity damage.

Pay your respects to our Lord Jesus because this describes his great courage in bearing the wrath of God on the cross. <r1>What’s interesting is that the face is our living identity record</r1>.

Why does the Lord God emphasise this particular suffering of our Lord Jesus? I’ll answer by first asking a question. What is the most severe plague of the devil against the Saints and even Mankind? Let me offer this answer => Jesus says that his disciples will receive all their daily provision in this life … but also persecution. Unless you go through a dry valley of persecution, torment and anguish of soul, the question of identity is not really compelling and some might say even a boring topic. But what if Satan wants to sift you like wheat? What if he’s planning to target you and destroy your life? Then you will quickly discover that guarding your true identity in Christ is essential for strength to fight the good fight. So, the most dangerous enemy plague could be destruction of God ordained and gracious identity. 

About being fit to fight the good fight, it’s not enough to just accept any old or new version of identity. You have to seek the Lord to receive your identity according to His grace. Otherwise .. you got no power :> !!

My case in point - the way of the world now commands people to “declare your pronouns”, to define your gender identity. To a sensible person it’s just weird, but to an affected person, true life just got a couple of shades darker.

In summary I believe that God wants to restore His people. Yes, God desires to clothe his people in Glory.

### **Living Clothing - Part 2**

Clothing is material that wraps the body and to some degree makes us human. There are different topics that answer why humans wear clothing. In practical terms, it is protection from sun, wind, rain and snow, to suit the prevailing temperature and humidity. 

Another aspect of clothing is social engineering. People wear clothing to help them connect with their “people” or “tribe”. Whether consciously or not, people dress in line with the culture and style that resonates with them.

Jesus has something to say about clothing =>

<bref>Matt 6:25-34 NIV</bref>

.<bref>25</bref> “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? <bref>26</bref> Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? <bref>27</bref> Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

.<bref>28</bref> “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. <bref>29</bref> Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <bref>30</bref> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? <bref>31</bref> So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ <bref>32</bref> For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. <bref>33</bref> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. <bref>34</bref> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

Consider that clothing helps to identify the wearer. The Lily’s clothing is its flower because that is how we definitely know it’s a Lily compared to some other similar plant. Notice that a flower is living flesh and living clothing, which actually is the Lord’s sermon secret. Notice also, that the flower is the “face” of the plant, because the flower is the living identity record. Jesus says, “Don’t worry about life’s necessities, God’s got you covered by His clothing”. Why? Because if you’re His, your identity is important. Being a child of God means you have His kingdom on the inside, projecting a worthy person image to the world. That’s so true. God says “believe in my Son Jesus and streams of living water will spring up inside your spirit !”. 

God says “Identify as a son or daughter to get your material needs filled. Believe that God provides each person with some kind of gift or talent.” God’s living clothing is the joyful uniqueness of a saint expressing their talent - graceful work or movement. Talent is an interesting word that originally was only known as a unit of weight. The parable of the talents introduced the God idea that endowed skill is virtual revenue. Such practical wisdom! God gives you a talent, and gives a virtual body to deploy the talent ( ya got it right => body = arrangement ;> ). Now you serve him in that body and convert your skill into money. With the money, you first honour Him by tithing, then live wise and well with the rest.

Let me give more context to the virtual body idea, just presented.

<bref>Psa 119:130 NKJV</bref>
The entrance of Your words gives light; It gives understanding to the simple

Recall that God’s arrangement is a body, which like a house has doors and gates. The Lord says, unless you accept God’s arrangement you can’t receive any light that explains what to do. Why? Because light only comes through one special entrance. Light is only available to those who walk through and sit in the entrance of the special host God has prepared.

<bref>Psa 40:6 BSB</bref>
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but my ears You have opened. Burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not require.

<bref>Heb 10:5 BSB</bref>
Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but **a body** You prepared for Me.

This NT verse is referring to messianic <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm"><u>psalm 40:6</u></a>, and I believe Holy Spirit is confirming that a body is needed to serve God. For Jesus, it meant coming into the world in the days of the Roman emperor Augustus. This emperor ordered a census that required Joseph to travel to his home town of Bethlehem. This event arranged the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, as foretold in the scriptures. 

<bref>John 4:34 BSB</bref>
Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.

Accepting God’s arrangement means accepting God’s will instead of our own. There is only food in **doing** the will of God. In this way of submission, we eat the flesh of Jesus and drink his blood. We eat the living bread. 

Holy Spirit says this about the mystery of marriage 

<bref>Mark 10:7-8 NIV</bref>
.<bref>7</bref> “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <bref>8</bref> and the two will become one flesh.” So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

This is a very strong witness, actually a logical proof, that the “flesh” of marriage is not literal flesh. Rather it means the unity of heart, soul, vision and finance that binds together a man and his wife in love.

### **The Living Bread**

<bref>Ecc 11:1 BSB</bref>
Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again

<bref>Matt 4:4 BSB</bref>
But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ”

Recall the God declares words are water. Casting your bread upon the waters first means carefully reading scripture, eating your bread. Scripture rehearsal again and again will memorise the words, digesting your bread and turning it into water. If you continue to occasionally rehearse for retention, you can recall it after many days. The natural body is sustained by bread, digesting the nutrients in the food. So new life comes through digesting the Word of God, allowing the words to transform our heart and spirit.

### **The Beast that devours Flesh**

<bref>Dan 7:5 BSB</bref>
Suddenly another beast appeared, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. So it was told, ‘Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!’

For tearing up flesh, "three ribs in its mouth" could mean a set of three fangs of each side instead of just one fang. Like a rib or tusk, these fangs are thick and powerful. However, that's just explaining the degree of power for spiritual intimidation. The beast will not literally devour people like a man-eating lion, but will terrorize mainly the saints of Jesus Christ. The mark of the beast is an economic law designed to extort idolatry from all peoples of the world. That is, unless you worship the beast you can’t do business or be employed. That’s extortion. Related to this evil rulership, the beast’s mission is to devour the flesh of God’s assignment for each of his saints. To virtually devour means to stop or block a person from doing their divine assignment. God's arrangement is this virtual body. Being full of grace, the body empowers the saints to do great exploits. It empowers because it gives a Divine licence to operate. By their great exploits the saints escape the mark of the beast as it says in Rev 15:2 =>

<bref>Rev 15:2a BSB</bref>
And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name. They were holding harps from God,

<bref>Rev 13:15 NIV</bref>
The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.

The image that is given power to speak surely must be an autonomous robot that is made in the image of man, which initially is speechless but very useful. Then as robotics become more advanced there will eventually be a new version that can that can speak and act, behaving in a more humanoid way.

### **Judgement of Babylon**

<bref>Jer 51:34-36</bref>
.<bref>34</bref> “Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me. He has set me aside like an empty vessel; he has swallowed me like a monster; he filled his belly with my delicacies and vomited me out. <bref>35</bref> May the violence done to me and to my flesh <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7607"><u>H7607</u></a> be upon Babylon,” says the dweller of Zion. “May my blood be on the dwellers of Chaldea,” says Jerusalem. <bref>36</bref> Therefore this is what the LORD says: “Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance on your behalf; I will dry up her sea and make her springs run dry.

In judging Babylon, the Lord documents the prayers of his exiled people. They say “may the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon”. Exile is a prison experience that compels Judah to realise how much better is serving Yahweh than serving gods of wood and stone. At the end of their time, the Lord helps them understand they have a “righteous cause” to call out and petition Him. In virtual prison, Judah endures punishment and the killing of their true body, God's best arrangement for Judah to serve Him. Notice also, that to diminish Babylon’s power, the Lord dries up her sea, the sea of “dominion and ruling class influence”.
