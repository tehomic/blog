<bref>Matt 25:14-19 BSB</bref>
.<bref>14</bref> For it is just like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions. <bref>15</bref> To one he gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one talent—each according to his own ability. And he went on his journey. <bref>16</bref> The servant who had received the five talents went at once and put them to work and gained five more. <bref>17</bref> Likewise, the one with the two talents gained two more. <bref>18</bref> But the servant who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. <bref>19</bref> After a long time the master of those servants returned to settle accounts with them. <bref>20</bref> The servant who had received the five talents came and presented five more. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’ <bref>21</bref> His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ <bref>22</bref> The servant who had received the two talents also came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents. See, I have gained two more.’ <bref>23</bref> His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’ <bref>24</bref> Finally, the servant who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. <bref>25</bref> So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what belongs to you.’ <bref>26</bref> ‘You wicked, lazy servant!’ replied his master. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed. <bref>27</bref> Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received it back with interest. <bref>28</bref> Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents. <bref>29</bref> For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. <bref>30</bref> And throw that worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

<bref>Matt 25:19 KJV</bref>

<br/>

The Day of Reckoning is a searching account of the servant’s work. Notice that the Lord expected each servant to invest their talent. What does it mean to invest your talent? According to God’s plan and calling, it means commitment to learn and grow, sometimes by stepping into the unknown. About God’s reckoning, look at the first Greek meaning, ‘to take up together with another or others’. As you might expect, investment should not happen in isolation, it needs some degree of support or partnership. In the early church, the laying on of hands was a formal way to invest someone to perform an office or role. Imagine that when Jesus does His reckoning other people connected with your life journey will be present. People working with people working out their goals, hopefully building a good life in Jesus name. Nothing is left in the dark, every motive is revealed. His reckoning will be either painful or joyful.

Given that the church has structure and hierarchy, the picture of Jesus reckoning with one or more people indicates that talent awareness is also a corporate church concern. This means the primary talent of some leaders is to provide advice, wisdom and counsel to help other people get the right view about their calling and their talent. This means the church really does need leadership people with the Holy Spirit gift of discernment. The Lord is right now sending a message to me and you the reader => “Discernment is not a ‘nice to have’ leadership function, rather IT IS imperative !”.

Leadership will have to account for how they fostered and nurtured their people’s skill and capacity, their talent pool. This means the higher a person is elevated in rank, the greater  burden that person has for seeing others with humility and respect. This is counter cultural, we don’t walk by sight, we walk by faith. By their humility, real leaders show the workers that walking by the Spirit is a highway of holiness.

This next scripture verse speaks directly about the two different stewards that Jesus will reckon with. One is the diligent person who prizes the gift and talent Jesus provided, the other is the lazy person who deliberately buries their talent.

<bref>Prov 12:27 BSB</bref>
A lazy man does not roast his game, but a diligent man prizes his possession.

<bref>Prov 12:27 KJV</bref>
The slothful <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7423"><u>H7423</u></a> man roasteth <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2760"><u>H2760</u></a> not that which he took in hunting <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6718"><u>H6718</u></a>: but the substance <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H1952"><u>H1952</u></a> of a diligent <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2742"><u>H2742</u></a> man <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H120"><u>H120</u></a> is precious <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H3368"><u>H3368</u></a>.

<bref>Prov 12:27 New American Bible</bref>
Sloth does not catch <b1>H2760</b1> its prey, but the wealth of the diligent is splendid.

<br/>

Perhaps <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm"><u>Prov 12:27</u></a> could be translated better by just using the lexicon terms that describe a lazy man. The only one that is inline with the real story is NAB that says “Sloth does not catch its prey”. Even this one does not really emphasis investment or commitment. A new concise version => The lazy man does not <b>start to catch</b> his game. Informative version => the lazy man does not <b>start learning to hunt</b>. Reckoning version => the lazy man does not <b>set in motion a plan to become a hunter</b>.

For me, the hunting theme is really pointing to goal management. Goal oriented people are hunters. They create a goal. They create a plan to attain it, then execute the plan. 

Apart from the diligent and the lazy stewards, there is another kind of servant, revealed only by reviewing this psalm with spiritual eyes. Let’s look at the Holy Spirit version of this psalm, using the elements marked above in gold highlights.

<bref>Prov 12:27 Holy Spirit Version</bref>
Treachery sets in motion [a scheme], hunting for substance. Then once caught, it decides what a man is worth.

<bref>Zech 11:12-13 NIV</bref>
.<bref>12</bref> I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver. <bref>13</bref> And the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter"—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the LORD.

This one is a messianic text, pointing to Jesus betrayed into the hands of Sin. Treachery represents Sin, the evil spectre of Satan’s kingdom. Jesus allowed himself to be caught by Sin and crucified, but on the Third day He rose from the dead! The Lord accepted this plan so that the scriptures would be fulfilled.

<bref>Psa 16:10 BSB</bref>
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.

There is another way to say substance - talented character. Since talent is the Lord’s own property then Jesus himself has talent ! That’s quite an understatement :>. If Jesus is fine with His super-star talent, it’s ok for you to have talent. Try not to think of talent as something that must be amazing and always has a wow factor. Talent is just what the bible calls a gift to serve Jesus and God. If you have a gift you have the anointing of Jesus, or you could say Holy Spirit anointing. 

If a disciple has talent but not enough character then that person is more vulnerable to temptation and sin. People with character flaws should expect to experience one or more humilty trials, so that they grow into their calling. Don't confuse character troubles with persecution!

<bref>2 Cor 2:10-11 NIV</bref>
.<bref>10</bref>Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, <bref>11</bref> in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.

Next is another proverbs verse that explores how Sin is actively hunting to trap, persecute and even kill. Pay attention !

<bref>Prov 19:24 KJV</bref>
A slothful <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6102"><u>H6102</u></a> man hideth <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2934"><u>H2934</u></a> his hand <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H3027"><u>H3027</u></a> in his bosom <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6747"><u>H6747</u></a>, and will not so much as bring <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7725"><u>H7725</u></a> it to his mouth <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H6310"><u>H6310</u></a> again <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7725"><u>H7725</u></a>.

This one also has a dual meaning, literal and spiritual. The literal text means what it says. A Christian sluggard is one who is called but refuses to start on a journey of growth and learning, according to the Lord’s plan not their own plan. Let’s look at the Holy Spirit version of this psalm, using the elements marked above in gold highlights.

<bref>Prov 19:24 Holy Spirit Version</bref>
Slothfulness conceals a person’s power to prosper, returning again and again to dash in pieces [hope for] restoration.

Slothfulness is the work of Sin enforcing obscurity. The real person is virtually killed. The substitute has no influence and no prosperity, without the Lord’s intervention. In this spiritual domain, the warden has orders to beat up and wear down even a determined jail breaker. Sin is enforcing a no talent expression mandate. 

What is the clue that shows this is real? The Hebrew verb <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/pro/19/1/t_conc_647024"><u>bring</u></a> has <a target="_blank" href="https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stem_hiphil.html"><u>Hiphil</u></a> tense applied, which is causative action. Meaning that Sin is the active player that traps a person, spoiling their talent. How does it have a mandate to do this? By the stealing authority from an authority holder. A parent, a relative, a pastor, a work or church leader.

To escape prison a holy <a target="_blank" href="https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stem_hophal.html"><u>Hophal</u></a> deliverance is needed. Hophal is the passive form of Hiphil tense. 
For deliverance it means "The battle is the Lords". 

Next, Isaiah gives some insight about what a dungeon experience is like.

<bref>Isa 42:6-7 NIV</bref>
.<bref>6</bref> “I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, <bref>7</bref> to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.

<bref>Isa 42:7 KJV</bref>
To open the blind eyes, to bring out <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H3318"><u>H3318</u></a> the prisoners <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H616"><u>H616</u></a> from the prison <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H4525"><u>H4525</u></a>, and them that sit in darkness <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2822"><u>H2822</u></a> out of the prison <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H3608"><u>H3608</u></a> house.

Review the gold highlights above. What does obscurity mean? It means your real life is effectively shut down, and without the Lord’s intervention, it will never see the light of day. 
Since the <a target="_blank" href="https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stem_hiphil.html"><u>Hiphil</u></a> tense applies, this means Sin causatively works to maintain state. The prisoner is actively restrained and actively forbidden to exercise their talent. The other Hiphil verb says “to deliver”, which points to a rescue mission by disciples working in the name of Jesus.

Recall that another way to describe substance is talented character. There is a less severe mode Christian obscurity. It happens when a person has lots of talent but not enough character then the Lord will bring humble arrangements to bear, so that His pupil gains more character.

This topic is esteemed by the the bible and the Lord God of Israel. Many honoured bible characters describe their real or virtual prison experience. Among them are Jacob, Joseph, Job, David and Daniel. As for Joseph, when he came out of a real prison his character was proven. He was now ready to handle great responsibility. 

<bref>Gen 50:20 NIV</bref>
You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.

<bref>Job 5:8-9 NIV</bref>
.<bref>8</bref> But if I were you, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him. <bref>9</bref> He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.

<bref>Psa 142:7 BSB</bref>
Free my soul from prison, that I may praise Your name. The righteous will gather around me because of Your goodness to me.

<bref>Isa 40:27-28 NIV</bref>
.<bref>27</bref> Why do you complain, Jacob? Why do you say, Israel, “My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God"? <bref>28</bref> Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
