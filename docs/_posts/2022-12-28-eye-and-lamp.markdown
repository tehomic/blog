### **The Eye is the Lamp of the Body - Part 1**

Recall that God made man in His image and likeness. The greatest feature of this likeness is man’s heart and his capacity to dream, conceive and believe. The experience of faith is evidence that we are created in God’s image. Faith is the inescapable design and function of Man’s heart. Non-believers and atheists do not change their heart from belief mode to unbelief mode by their unbelief. Ironically, they just believe that unbelief is justified. But to those who do believe, God says “Now render the flesh of your domain”. What is this domain? The dictionary says “domain is an area of territory owned or controlled by a particular ruler”, which says it ALL. In the heart of man, your domain is the playground or pavilion for ruling and reigning. Recall that Hebrew word <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H7607"><u>H7607</u></a> means flesh, and the root verb means to swell. Rendering the flesh means to materialise your vision in the flesh. It’s not a coincidence that to conceive means both to actually and virtually create a new body. The first case means flesh swells in a mother’s womb, creating a new body while the Lord creates a new soul. The second case refers to the grand design of Man’s heart. By the power of vision and faith in man’s heart, virtual flesh swells creating a new body for man to work out his plans.

<subhead><p>Jesus is the Bridegroom</p></subhead>

<bref>Psa 19:1-6 BSB</bref>
.<bref>1</bref> The heavens declare the Glory of God and the skies proclaim the work of his hands. <bref>2</bref> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night, they reveal knowledge. <bref>3</bref> Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard, <bref>4</bref> their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun <bref>5</bref> Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. <bref>6</bref> It rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.

The voiceless heavenly language includes the encoded laws of the natural universe, such as gravity. Man’s interpretation is mathematics. They also touch the foundations of the earth, the ministry of life generation. See <a target="_blank" href="/bible/exposition/2022/12/24/son-of-man.html"><u>The Son of Man</u></a> article for details. About the bridegroom. There is only one biblical promise connected to “bridegroom”. That is Messiah or Christ.

Looking now to Jesus talking about the “eye that is a lamp”

<bref>Matt 6:22-24 BSB</bref>
.<bref>22</bref> “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. <bref>23</bref> But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then, the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness. <bref>24</bref> No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”

<bref>Mark 4:21-25 BSB</bref>
.<bref>21</bref> Jesus also said to them “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under and a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand?” <bref>22</bref> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light”. <bref>23</bref> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear. <bref>24</bref> He went on to say “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use it will be measured to you and even more will be added to you. <bref>25</bref> For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him”

The Lord says “If anyone has ears to hear let him hear”. I believe He means “Therefore if you have a witness that says ‘If only God would reveal secrets about my personal struggle’ then **pay attention to what you hear**”. 

Prophetic insight that unveils glorious hidden items will rewrite identity records. The Lord says “Glory revealed from the inside will beam out of their faces !”

<bref>Luke 8:16-18 BSB</bref>
.<bref>16</bref> “No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar, or puts it under a bed. Instead he sets it on a stand so that those who enter can see the light. <bref>17</bref> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light”. <bref>18</bref>
“Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him”

The Lord says “If anyone has ears to hear let him hear”. I believe He means “Therefore if you have a witness that says ‘If only God would reveal secrets about my personal struggle’ then **pay attention to how you listen**”

Prophetic insight that unveils glorious hidden items will rewrite identity records. The Lord says “Glory revealed from the inside will beam out of their faces !”

<bref>Luke 11:33-36 BSB</bref>
.<bref>33</bref> “No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead he sets it on a stand so that those who enter can see the light. <bref>34</bref> Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they’re bad, your body is full of darkness”. <bref>35</bref> “Be careful then that the light within you is not darkness. <bref>36</bref> So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.” Or NIV says “as when a lamp shines on you”

God’s word says the “eye” is a fountain. That’s a beautiful way to describe a lamp - a fountain of light. Compare the function of the natural eye to the spiritual eye. The former is passive in that it requires external light and is stimulated by light. The latter is a “light” projector that streams True or False faith pictures into the inner world of man, the body of the heart. Light is not describing the actual thing emitted, it describes the type of thing emitted, whether True or False. The actual things emitted are faith pictures, imagery that either builds up a person in the Truth or tears down a person in the False. Faith is the inescapable default function of Man’s heart.

Read what God says about the heart of man. The Strong’s definition of the verb “labab” says => to be enclosed. I believe this is the core definition of a body or host. A closed system that provides a habitable place, an environment for doing work. The Earth is a closed system in terms of mass but not energy. Without the help of a powerful rocket, and leaving out quantum theory, no person, not even a single molecule can escape the gravity of Earth.

The spiritual eye is an imagery fountain, a fountain of word-pictures that either buildup a person in the Truth, or tear down a person in the False. Identity is influenced by a whole catalogue of diverse things. But only one thing is needed. Light. Jesus Christ is the Light that illuminates the inner world of man. This is a body, because you .. live .. in .. it. **The heart does not live in you, you live in your heart**. The heart is more powerful than even the most enlightened disciple of Jesus could apprehend. I say apprehend, because to imagine is just entry level expertise, apprehending is a much higher level of working knowledge. 

<bref>Proverbs 9:10 NIV</bref>
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

<bref>Proverbs 16:11 NKJV</bref>
Honest weights and scales are the LORD’s; All the weights in the bag **are His work**

<bref>Isa 28:23-26 NIV</bref>
.<bref>23</bref> Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. <bref>24</bref> When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil? <bref>25</bref> When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cumin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field? <bref>26</bref> His God instructs him and **teaches him the right way**.

The Lord graciously gives inspiration for people to apply knowledge. Without application, of course, there’s no benefit. In the field of academic science things are more intense, God provides inspiration but also the enemy can and does exert influence, especially to stir up rage against the intelligent design of God in the beginning. The world continues for each person according to what they believe. If you believe that wood does not melt, then you limit wood from melting. You might say “What ?! Wood burns .. wax and plastic can melt but wood burns”. 

You might know that atoms are the principal components that constitute all physical matter. Atoms in turn are composed of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons and electrons. Atoms can also be defined in terms of bounded energy. Atomic energy is **enclosed** in a container that just exists. I personally believe science leaves this property alone and ignores it, because it’s potentially touching the virtual realm. Maybe it’s a tiny 3D electromagnetic field that creates a boundary? Apparently not.

Remember that God is the Lord of Hosts. I believe the Lord makes a virtual container, a tiny host that contains the material energy of an atom. It’s interesting that bounded atomic energy defines an atom’s mass density. There’s a whole new frontier emerging on this subject, so get excited ! see Appendix A. I suggest that if this atomic host is a virtual container then that means wood can melt. Peter's epistle says that when this present creation is eventually destroyed the elements will melt in the process. Imagine it ... all God needs to do to destroy the physical creation is to universally collapse every virtual atomic host. All matter would instantly melt in a huge sea of unbounded energy!

### **The Eye is the Lamp of the Body - Part 2**

How does the spiritual eye “see” the world? Since this internal eye of the heart is a projector of light, **it sees according to faith**. The Light of Christ illuminates the soul with Truth. In this Light, seeing means understanding the gospel of Jesus Christ as Holy Spirit reveals the details. 

<bref>Prov 4:18-19 NIV</bref>
.<bref>18</bref> The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. <bref>19</bref> But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.

<bref>John 11:9-10</bref>
.<bref>9</bref> Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. <bref>10</bref> It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”

In this teaching by the Lord Jesus, what or where is the place that is lit by the “daylight” of Christ? It must be this inner world, where the soul is illuminated by faith. Faith which is either true or false, light or darkness. With the Holy Spirit’s help, we can correctly understand and adopt God’s word as our life pattern. Jesus is the Way to life. He leads on the path of holiness. By adopting His way of life, the saint will not stumble, because there is light to see and the path is not treacherous.

<bref>Prov 8:18 KJV</bref>
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H2315"><u>H2315</u></a> of the belly <a target="_blank" href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/strongs/H990"><u>H990</u></a>.

<bref>Prov 8:18 NKJV</bref>
The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles, And they go down into the inmost body.

<bref>Prov 8:18 BSB</bref>
The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.

beten, beh'-ten; from an unused root probably meaning **to be hollow**; the belly, especially the womb; also the bosom or body of anything: — belly, **body**, + as they be born, + within, womb
<hr/>
<br/>

The word of God confirms another aspect of the inner body. Not only is it enclosed but it is hollow, which means there is habitable space inside. Like a large mansion, it has as many chambers as there are identity attributes.

When Jesus teaches about the eye, the lamp of your body, he describes the lamp’s position in relation to the soul. First he says “the light within you” and second he says “light that shines on you”. The “light within you” is the lamp of faith, the “sun” of your inner world. The “light that shines on you” points to the soul walking under the sun, in the daylight of Christ or the nightlight of unbelief. I purposely say nightlight since the Lord warns “if the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness”. On the bright side of the believer spectrum, Holy Spirit desires to lead us into all truth. As <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm"><u>Prov 4:18</u></a> says “shining ever brighter till the full light of day”. 

In summary, this lamp projects what you believe into the space of your worldview. This is not a weird “new age” thing that I’m talking about. Worldview simply means “the way you see yourself in the world, as a person with either permission to rule or not". For the saints, it’s not a secret that identity and value are totally shaped by how we relate to God, our Creator. This could be a special witness embedded deep in the spirit and mind of every human. Why? Because as <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-16.htm"><u>Num 27:16</u></a> KJV says, Israel's God is the God of the spirits of all flesh. It’s an inescapable spiritual reality. 

Just because someone is adamantly opposed to faith in Jesus and God, does not mean they can eradicate the super-subtle awareness of their Creator. Awareness that says “you are not designed to be autonomous”. 

This intrinsic worldview casts every person as a potential ruler inside their domain. No one can rule or reign in darkness. The brightness of God’s word depends on how you personally understand and value it. 

Recall <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm"><u>Psa 19:5</u></a> => “Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course”. Jesus is the bridegroom who enters your domain and meets with you. He can reveal secrets. This means by faith we can enter into a holy and personal partnership with Christ to discover the knowledge of God. We can become like Him. Like a champion, rejoicing to run their course.

### **Appendix A**

It might yet be revealed that the mass density science is more important than that of matter and particles. Consider two identical (ideal gas) air compressors, called C1 and C2. The experiment starts with each compressor showing 100 KPa, each one at room temperature. Now we adjust the C1 compressor, so it pumps more air into the tank, maintaining room temperature, until the pressure gauge shows 200 KPa. For C2, we circulate the original air volume through an air heater connected to the tank, raising the air temperature until the pressure = 200 KPa. 

Now some gas equations to help examine things =>
```
PV = nRT 

P : pressure
V : volume
n : number of gas moles
R : gas constant
T : absolute temperature
```
```
ρ = PM/RT

ρ : density
P : pressure
M : Molar mass
R : gas constant
T : absolute temperature
```

Density is proportional to pressure at constant temperature, as equation 2 confirms => 
ρRT = PM

For C1, if the temperature doesn’t change then double the pressure means double the density. 

First, consider that the pressure of C1 is equivalent to the mass density of C1, because they are both derived from the same metric => the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. You might protest, saying “mass density does not depend on the gas motion”.  Ok, I’ll rephrase my statement. They are both derived from the same metric =>  the space between gas molecules. 

In a closed system, gas motion is an intrinsic property of a gas, in terms of equal pressure everywhere inside the volume. It’s curious that space between molecules is the connecting property between gas pressure and the mass density of a gas.

To state that explicitly =>

**In terms of pressure**, gas motion is an intrinsic property that 1. distributes the gas molecules in the total available space and 2. calibrates the speed of each molecule as a function of temperature. 

**In terms of mass density**, gas motion is an intrinsic property that distributes the gas molecules in the total available space, calibrating the space between molecules, as a function of temperature.

So now I can confidently assert that C1 pressure is equivalent to C1 mass density. 

Now let me introduce my alternate scientific idea => virtual mass density. 

Recall that C1 pressure = C2 pressure = 200 KPa

How does the mass density of each tank compare, each closed system ? 

Since the pressure is equal, the gas motion of C1 is **<i>equivalent</i>** to the gas motion of C2.

The meaning of equivalent by <a target="_blank" href="https://collinsdictionary.com/equivalent"><u>collinsdictionary.com</u></a> is =>

1. equal or interchangeable in value, quantity, significance, etc
2. having the same or a similar effect or meaning

If the gas motion is equivalent, then the molecular spacing of C1 is equivalent to the molecular spacing of C2.

If the molecular spacing is equivalent then the mass density is equivalent, because mass density of a gas is a function of molecular spacing. 

The curious thing is that gas motion seems to be a property of space itself not the gas.

Thus the equivalent mass density is also equal. 

Notice I didn’t say the mass density of C1 equals C2, I said the equivalent or virtual mass density is equal. 

The C1 versus C2 experiment shows that the kinetic energy of C2’s hot molecules must add energy density to the system. Note, in the experiment scope, the context of kinetic energy density is statistical not mechanical or chemical. That is, it increases the probability of a sample event succeeding.

Thus, in terms of gas motion, the energy density of C1 = C2, where total energy density equals the sum or integral of the kinetic energy of each gas molecule.

The principle is statistical not physical, it does not depend on total mass per volume. It depends on the frequency of mass distribution. 

A virtual mass density law might require that molecules move such that sampling events succeed for the required sampling rate. In reality, I’m inclined to trust that we don’t need to detect particles, but we prove the case by measuring side-effects. In this experiment, the side effect that upholds my theory is equal pressure.

<subhead><p>Space controls Virtual Mass Density</p></subhead>

Virtual mass density seems to be controlled by space. Space calibrates the space between gas molecules in a closed container, as a function of temperature.

Virtual mass density could be an intrinsic property of space or spacetime, and is connected with gravity. The earth orbits the sun because Space demands that mass be distributed in the available space of a closed system. You might say “the earth’s orbital range is not in a closed system”. Well it is in terms of passive physical matter. The sun’s “local” gravitational influence dominates all the planets that orbit around it.

Virtual mass density works in the virtual domain, at least in the realm of stars. It works in the inner core of stars, generating virtual gravitational power. It equals mass existence probability, according to mass distribution frequency. The virtual domain could mean the statistical domain. It could explain dark matter and or dark energy.

<subhead><p>Gravity is a Virtual Atomic Host Property</p></subhead>

Recall my assertion that mass is defined by a virtual atomic host that contains atomic energy, creating atomic mass density. Since gravity is a property of mass then gravity is an intrinsic property of the virtual atomic host, by way of association. This implies that gravity is connected to the virtual realm. This in turn implies that the mechanics of gravity also depend on the virtual realm. 

Ever noticed that although the earth is rotating, you don't feel even the slightest sensation of movement? If motion is a constant velocity then there are no forces that impart a movement sensation. But if the earth is actually rotating, it's motion is contantly changing direction because of the circuloid path it keeps, while moving through space. Gravity keeps you connected to the earth, by exerting it's force directed towards the center of the earth. In terms of angular momentum, the angular rate of change is quite gentle. It changes 1 degree per 4 minutes = 360 degress per 1440 minutes = 360 degress per 24 hours. At the equator the earth's circumference = 40,075 kms, and a 1 degree arc covers 111.4 kms. However, the speed of rotation at the equator is about 460 meters per second. For a circular-ish path that changes direction constantly, that's an incredibly fast movement, considering we don't feel any sensation. The closed system of gravity explains why the atmosphere is not affected, but I think it's a bit too convenient that there's no science to explain how circular motion, which is an acceleration, has zero effect on about perception of inertia. Scientists are building all kinds of super-sensitive instruments to measure gravity waves and detection of neutrino radiation (which might be a red herring). The laws of physics are apparently violated by the undetectablility of earth's rotation, but no wants to build a super-sensitive movement detector. Although, after doing more googling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0210rotation.html"><u>this NASA project</u></a> might resolve my concerns.

For what it's worth, my hunch is that the earth does not literally move through space, rather the earth virtually moves through time. This might be the Lord God's amazing design. This explains why there is zero physical sensation of movement. There is a movement sensation, but only in terms of time. Humans are conscious of moving through time. The speed of time is a fundamental part of human consciousness. In the light of real wisdom, the actual definition of sensation is defined by faith and not feelings. If I believe the earth moves through time and not space, then that is my worldview.

<subhead><p>Harmonic Gravity</p></subhead>

Not sure but apparently science says that implosive gravitational power is constantly in balance with thermal explosive power. A static system requires that a star’s inner core is continuously consuming its fuel, like a candle burning wax. 

A harmonic cycle draws a sine wave. This explains why planets are bound in orbit because the harmonic gravity field is self-regulating, exerting a “release and capture” kind of containment.

I’ll try to describe this harmonic cycle. Same idea of implosion versus explosion but not static, instead moving in a cycle. The cycle has 2 parts, compression and expansion. About fusion, the product element is more dense, so star mass density increases as it ages. Seems that this dynamic cycle is only possible because the stellar inner core is always increasing gravitational power. 

On the flip side, because of fusion, a star becomes lighter as it ages. According to E=mc2, a fusion reaction mass product is less than the total mass input. If I'm not mistaken, the output energy is the binding energy difference (strong nuclear force) of the input and output elements. <a target="_blank" href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Nuclear_Chemistry/Nuclear_Energetics_and_Stability/Energetics_of_Nuclear_Reactions"><u>Fusion of elements</u></a> lighter than iron may release energy to generate nuclei with greater binding energy (per nucleon). My way of understanding how greater nuclear binding energy equates to energy release, is to see binding energy as the nuclear stability metric. Higher binding energy means greater binding efficiency and more stability. In terms of efficiency, it's comparible to magnetic circuit "binding" strength as a function of magnetic reluctance. 

The cycle could be a combination of 2 harmonic cycles. One is a thermal-stability probability cycle. The other is a gravitational-stability probability cycle. Thermal stability means the chance of death by explosion is low. Gravitational stability means the chance of death by implosion is low. 

Let’s start the cycle at the max. or min. point of the sine wave, where gradient = 0. This is the pressure equilibrium point and represents the maximum probability of star stability. After this point gravity overpowers thermal pressure and the compression phase begins. The sine wave zero point is the fusion ignition event and means undefined probability, but not impossibility. Rather, it means zero probability of correctly predicting one state or the other. A strange state of Unknowable ! Only the Lord knows what will happen. Stable thermal expansion or explosion? 

The fusion event is explosive in 2 aspects. Massive temperature increase is explosive, causing thermal expansion. But also a mass density flux “explosion”, increasing gravity power. Virtual mass density is working, since thermal energy is contained by gravity. So the inner core’s dynamic gravity dominates thermal expansion, and the expansion phase slows down to equilibrium and then the cycle starts again. The majority of stars are less than **8M and don’t have instability issues. But, there are massive “time bomb” like stars that were born to explode, ie, supernova. 

Supernova of a large mass star reveals what is going on. Apparently, only the “outer body” is blown apart, the inner core implodes into either a black hole or a neutron star. This is evidence that the inner core is a virtual closed system because it is a real explosion. What is the main thing needed for explosive conditions? Answer : a container that contains a volatile substance. It seems that the tipping point for explosion happens when gravity power goes beyond a max threshold where it resists thermal expansion enough to cause fusion to runaway exponentially. But gravity power will also increase exponentially ! 
In this incredible fiery furnace, heavy elements like uranium are synthesised. It’s amazing that when it blows, thermal pressure apparently splits gravity's container, ripping it open. 

It’s curious that <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm"><u>Prov 3:20</u></a>, a creation narrative, says the deep was ripped open. I believe the Deep is an interface between heaven and earth. Or in pseudo-science prose, the Deep is an interface between the virtual and spacetime worlds. By the mega magnitude of power released in a supernova, the ripping open of an almost impregnable cosmic container, surely there is a “not of this world” event occuring in the mix.

About the amazing cosmic properties revealed by supernova explosion. Surely this can help us understand God's word and God's world. Clearly there are super intense forces colliding inside a star leading up to a supanova. Super intense gravity makes a plasma prison, so that nothing with mass can escape. But eventually the container is apparently ripped open, exploding in a BIG fireball. Recall though that the Lord God made an atomic host, a little container that makes mass matter. That's a pun, but it might be true ! Without the atomic boundary, there is no atomic mass and no matter. Look again at the verb tenses listed for H1949. Could one of theses tenses give a clue about the death of an atom? The only one that seems helpful is Hithpael, which says "to burst themselves open". The inner core gravity prison might be defeated by atomic self destruction. So the story might read => at a certain threshold of temperature and pressure, atomic integrity fails, and the plasma (ionized atoms) begins to melt. Haha !! I don't mean physically melt like hot wax, I mean the virtual container of each plasma atom collapses, so that it is no longer a mass particle and thus can escape gravity confinement .. which means a biiigg explosion. 

If this is a valid idea, then it requires more work. How does the exploded star mass get reconstucted in the explosion aftermath? It might be that atomic reformation happens as soon as the sea of exploded atomic energy cools. 

About the idea that plasma atoms "burst themselves open". Due to the compressive gravity power of the stellar inner core, plasma atoms might be squashed so powerfully that the host collapses, giving up its former internal space. The culprit might be powerful thermal pressure flux waves causing a pressure differential and a tearing force. The randomness of nuclear fusion ignition could produce such a pressure flux, working like an atomic host destroyer.

### **Summary**

About my virtual mass density theory. It may not be sensible or valid to some people. But the only thing that matters is if Spacetime agrees saying “yes, virtual mass density is one of my properties”. Praise Jesus !
