### **Virtual Atomic Host**

You might know that atoms are the principal components that constitute all physical matter. Atoms in turn are composed of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons and electrons. Atoms can also be defined in terms of bounded energy. Atomic energy is **enclosed** in a container that just exists. I personally believe science leaves this property alone and ignores it, because it’s potentially touching the virtual realm. Maybe it’s a tiny 3D electromagnetic field that creates a boundary? Apparently not.

Remember that God is the Lord of Hosts. I believe the Lord makes a virtual container, a tiny host that contains the material energy of an atom. That is, the energy that defines it as a particle, an atom. It’s interesting that this bounded energy also defines atomic mass density. 

### **Virtual Mass Density**

It might yet be revealed that the mass density science is more important than that of matter and particles. Consider two identical (ideal gas) air compressors, called C1 and C2. The experiment starts with each compressor showing 100 KPa, each one at room temperature. Now we adjust the C1 compressor, so it pumps more air into the tank, maintaining room temperature, until the pressure gauge shows 200 KPa. For C2, we circulate the original air volume through an air heater connected to the tank, raising the air temperature until the pressure = 200 KPa. 

Now some gas equations to help examine things =>
```
PV = nRT 

P : pressure
V : volume
n : number of gas moles
R : gas constant
T : absolute temperature
```
```
ρ = PM/RT

ρ : density
P : pressure
M : Molar mass
R : gas constant
T : absolute temperature
```

Density is proportional to pressure at constant temperature, as equation 2 confirms => 
ρRT = PM

For C1, if the temperature doesn’t change then double the pressure means double the density. 

First, consider that the pressure of C1 is equivalent to the mass density of C1, because they are both derived from the same metric => the kinetic energy of the gas molecules. You might protest, saying “mass density does not depend on the gas motion”.  Ok, I’ll rephrase my statement. They are both derived from the same metric =>  the space between gas molecules. 

In a closed system, gas motion is an intrinsic property of a gas, in terms of equal pressure everywhere inside the volume. It’s curious that space between molecules is the connecting property between gas pressure and the mass density of a gas.

To state that explicitly =>

**In terms of pressure**, gas motion is an intrinsic property that 1. distributes the gas molecules in the total available space and 2. calibrates the speed of each molecule as a function of temperature. 

**In terms of mass density**, gas motion is an intrinsic property that distributes the gas molecules in the total available space, calibrating the space between molecules, as a function of temperature.

So now I can confidently assert that C1 pressure is equivalent to C1 mass density. 

Now let me introduce my alternate scientific idea => virtual mass density. 

Recall that C1 pressure = C2 pressure = 200 KPa

How does the mass density of each tank compare, each closed system ? 

Since the pressure is equal, the gas motion of C1 is **<i>equivalent</i>** to the gas motion of C2.

The meaning of equivalent by <a target="_blank" href="https://collinsdictionary.com/equivalent"><u>collinsdictionary.com</u></a> is =>

1. equal or interchangeable in value, quantity, significance, etc
2. having the same or a similar effect or meaning

If the gas motion is equivalent, then the molecular spacing of C1 is equivalent to the molecular spacing of C2.

If the molecular spacing is equivalent then the mass density is equivalent, because mass density of a gas is a function of molecular spacing. 

The curious thing is that gas motion seems to be a property of space itself not the gas.

Thus the equivalent mass density is also equal. 

Notice I didn’t say the mass density of C1 equals C2, I said the equivalent or virtual mass density is equal. 

The C1 versus C2 experiment shows that the kinetic energy of C2’s hot molecules must add energy density to the system. Note, in the experiment scope, the context of kinetic energy density is statistical not mechanical or chemical. That is, it increases the probability of a sample event succeeding.

Thus, in terms of gas motion, the energy density of C1 = C2, where total energy density equals the sum or integral of the kinetic energy of each gas molecule.

The principle is statistical not physical, it does not depend on total mass per volume. It depends on the frequency of mass distribution. 

A virtual mass density law might require that molecules move such that sampling events succeed for the required sampling rate. In reality, I’m inclined to trust that we don’t need to detect particles, but we prove the case by measuring side-effects. In this experiment, the side effect that upholds my theory is equal pressure.

<subhead><p>Space controls Virtual Mass Density</p></subhead>

Virtual mass density seems to be controlled by space. Space calibrates the space between gas molecules in a closed container, as a function of temperature.

Virtual mass density could be an intrinsic property of Space or Spacetime, and is connected with gravity. The earth orbits the sun because Space demands that mass be distributed in the available space of a closed system. You might say “the local gravity of the sun is not in a closed system”. Well it is in terms of passive physical matter. The sun’s “local” gravitational influence dominates all the planets that orbit around it.

Virtual mass density works in the virtual domain, at least in the realm of stars. It works in the inner core of stars, generating virtual gravitational power. It equals mass existence probability, according to mass distribution frequency. The virtual domain could mean the statistical domain. It could explain dark matter and or dark energy.

<subhead><p>Gravity is a Virtual Atomic Host Property</p></subhead>

Recall my assertion that mass is defined by a virtual atomic host that contains atomic energy, creating atomic mass density. Since gravity is a property of mass then gravity is an intrinsic property of the virtual atomic host, by way of association. This implies that gravity is connected to the virtual realm. This in turn implies that the mechanics of gravity also depend on the virtual realm. Considering that the whole natural world is upheld by the work of Gravity, there must be a Generation of Atom just as there is a Generation of Man. This Generation is the Ministry of Gravity in the heavenly realm. Sounds like nonsense? This is a spiritual theme and does not need any natural recognition.

Ever noticed that although the earth is rotating, you don't feel even the slightest sensation of movement? If motion is a constant velocity then there are no forces that impart a movement sensation. But if the earth is actually rotating, it's motion is contantly changing direction because of the circuloid path it keeps, while moving through space. Gravity keeps you connected to the earth, by exerting it's force directed towards the center of the earth. In terms of angular momentum, the angular rate of change is quite gentle. It changes 1 degree per 4 minutes = 360 degress per 1440 minutes = 360 degress per 24 hours. At the equator the earth's circumference = 40,075 kms, and a 1 degree arc covers 111.4 kms. However, the speed of rotation at the equator is about 460 meters per second. For a circular-ish path that changes direction constantly, that's an incredibly fast movement, considering we don't feel any sensation. The closed system of gravity explains why the atmosphere is not affected, but I think it's a bit too convenient that there's no science to explain how circular motion, which is an acceleration, has zero effect on about perception of inertia. Scientists are building all kinds of super-sensitive instruments to measure gravity waves and detection of neutrino radiation (which might be a red herring). The laws of physics are apparently violated by the undetectablility of earth's rotation, but no wants to build a super-sensitive movement detector. Although, after doing more googling <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0210rotation.html"><u>this NASA project</u></a> might resolve my concerns.

For what it's worth, my hunch is that the earth does not literally move through space, rather the earth virtually moves through time. This might be the Lord God's amazing design. This explains why there is zero physical sensation of movement. There is a movement sensation, but only in terms of time. Humans are conscious of moving through time. The speed of time is a fundamental part of human consciousness. In the light of real wisdom, the actual definition of sensation is defined by faith and not feelings. If I believe the earth moves through time and not space, then that is my worldview.

<subhead><p>Harmonic Gravity</p></subhead>

Not sure but apparently science says that implosive gravitational power is constantly in balance with thermal explosive power. A static system requires that a star’s inner core is continuously consuming its fuel, like a candle burning wax. 

A harmonic cycle draws a sine wave. This explains why planets are bound in orbit because the harmonic gravity field is self-regulating, exerting a “release and capture” kind of containment.

I’ll try to describe this harmonic cycle. Same idea of implosion versus explosion but not static, instead moving in a cycle. The cycle has 2 parts, compression and expansion. About fusion, the product element is more dense, so star mass density increases as it ages. Seems that this dynamic cycle is only possible because the stellar inner core is always increasing gravitational power. 

On the flip side, because of fusion, a star becomes lighter as it ages. According to E=mc2, a fusion reaction mass product is less than the total mass input. If I'm not mistaken, the output energy is the binding energy difference (strong nuclear force) of the input and output elements. <a target="_blank" href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Nuclear_Chemistry/Nuclear_Energetics_and_Stability/Energetics_of_Nuclear_Reactions"><u>Fusion of elements</u></a> lighter than iron may release energy to generate nuclei with greater binding energy (per nucleon). My way of understanding how greater nuclear binding energy equates to energy release, is to see binding energy as the nuclear stability metric. Higher binding energy means greater binding efficiency and more stability. In terms of efficiency, it's comparible to magnetic circuit "binding" strength as a function of magnetic reluctance. 

The cycle could be a combination of 2 harmonic cycles. One is a thermal-stability probability cycle. The other is a gravitational-stability probability cycle. Thermal stability means the chance of death by explosion is low. Gravitational stability means the chance of death by implosion is low. 

Let’s start the cycle at the max. or min. point of the sine wave, where gradient = 0. This is the pressure equilibrium point and represents the maximum probability of star stability. After this point gravity overpowers thermal pressure and the compression phase begins. The sine wave zero point is the fusion ignition event and means undefined probability, but not impossibility. Rather, it means zero probability of correctly predicting one state or the other. A strange state of Unknowable ! Only the Lord knows what will happen. Stable thermal expansion or explosion? 

The fusion event is explosive in 2 aspects. Massive temperature increase is explosive, causing thermal expansion. But also a mass density flux “explosion”, increasing gravity power. Virtual mass density is working, since thermal energy is contained by gravity. So the inner core’s dynamic gravity dominates thermal expansion, and the expansion phase slows down to equilibrium and then the cycle starts again. The majority of stars are less than **8M and don’t have instability issues. But, there are massive “time bomb” like stars that were born to explode, ie, supernova. 

Supernova of a large mass star reveals what is going on. Apparently, only the “outer body” is blown apart, the inner core implodes into either a black hole or a neutron star. This is evidence that the inner core is a virtual closed system because it is a real explosion. What is the main thing needed for explosive conditions? Answer : a container that contains a volatile substance. It seems that the tipping point for explosion happens when gravity power goes beyond a max threshold where it resists thermal expansion enough to cause fusion to runaway exponentially. But gravity power will also increase exponentially ! 
In this incredible fiery furnace, heavy elements like uranium are synthesised. It’s amazing that when it blows, thermal pressure apparently splits gravity's container, ripping it open. 

It’s curious that <a target="_blank" href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm"><u>Prov 3:20</u></a>, a creation narrative, says the deep was ripped open. I believe the Deep is an interface between heaven and earth. Or in pseudo-science prose, the Deep is an interface between the virtual and spacetime worlds. By the mega magnitude of power released in a supernova, the ripping open of an almost impregnable cosmic container, surely there is a “not of this world” event occuring in the mix.

About the amazing cosmic properties revealed by supernova explosion. Surely this can help us understand God's word and God's world. Clearly there are super intense forces colliding inside a star leading up to a supanova. Super intense gravity makes a plasma prison, so that nothing with mass can escape. But eventually the container is apparently ripped open, exploding in a BIG fireball. Recall though that the Lord God made an atomic host, a little container that makes mass matter. That's a pun, but it might be true ! Without the atomic boundary, there is no atomic mass and no matter. Look again at the verb tenses listed for H1949. Could one of theses tenses give a clue about the death of an atom? The only one that seems helpful is Hithpael, which says "to burst themselves open". The inner core gravity prison might be defeated by atomic self destruction. So the story might read => at a certain threshold of temperature and pressure, atomic integrity fails, and the plasma (ionized atoms) begins to melt. Haha !! I don't mean physically melt like hot wax, I mean the virtual container of each plasma atom collapses, so that it is no longer a mass particle and thus can escape gravity confinement .. which means a biiigg explosion. 

If this is a valid idea, then it requires more work. How does the exploded star mass get reconstucted in the explosion aftermath? It might be that atomic reformation happens as soon as the sea of exploded atomic energy cools. 

About the idea that plasma atoms "burst themselves open". Either the bursting is remotely governed by the Generaton of Atom, or the atomic code has a burst threshold awareness. By atomic code I mean there is a virtual program running inside every atom, governing the atomic lifecycle. Logically, the collapse condition could be due to the compressive gravity power of the stellar inner core. The plasma atoms might be squashed so powerfully that the host collapses, giving up its "internal" space. But at the atomic scale how can space be defined or measured? A scientist might try estimate the diameter of a hydrogen atom, but I'm inclined to believe that measurable space has a lower limit. It's more likely that, according to the Lord God's design, the atom represents the lower limit of space measurement. Atomic partical existance might be explained by probability energy density. Collisions occur because the law of mass distribution allows them, or requires them. This mass distribution law might be virtually observable using a wave interference technique that shows particle trajectory, represented by constructive interference lines. If gravity is indeed a harmonic cycle, then that might give rise to harmonic propogation of virtual gravity waves, that constitute mass probability energy density flux inside the local star system. These lines bounce or reflect against the virtual boundary of a star's gravitational range. I'm inclined to believe there has to be propagation beyond the star's own boundary, but I don't know. Maybe there is proportionate reflection, refraction or transition at the boundary depending on some currently unknown metric or property. Constructive wave interference represents the maximum probablistic energy density inside a closed system. About these ideas, I don't care if they're not correct. My objective is to promote discussion about an alternative science model, which acknowledges and depends on the virtual realm, which I believe is a true account of the real universe.

### **Summary**

About my virtual mass density theory. It may not be sensible or valid to some people. But the only thing that matters is if Spacetime agrees saying “yes, virtual mass density is one of my properties”. Praise Jesus !
